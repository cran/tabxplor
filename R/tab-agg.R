# PURPOSE: The aggregate core's arithmetic -- sufficient-statistic aggregation, the confidence-
#   interval engines, and the vectorised whole-table tests.
# ROLE: The single computation core both leaves route through (R/tab-leaf.R): counts and moment
#   sums in, fmt fields out. It owns no table structure and touches no fmt record -- every function
#   here takes plain vectors or a data.table and returns plain vectors.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - TWO declared vocabularies, side by side: CI_METHODS says which METHOD a kind of interval may be
#     built with, CI_GEOMS which INTERVAL a column's plan asks for. Read CI_GEOMS only through its
#     accessors, so its three consumers cannot answer the reference-cell question differently.
#   - The engines are ELEMENTWISE over cells and know nothing of a variable's level set, so a method
#     whose variance is pooled over that set (CI_POOLED: "ols", "quasipoisson") takes it as `pool`,
#     computed by the caller through ci_pool_disp(). Never give an engine a grouping key instead: the
#     vectors it receives span total rows and sub-tables, which no key in its argument list separates.
#   - SIGNIFICANCE IS CI-INVERSION. The stored per-cell `pvalue` inverts the SAME interval that drew
#     the bracket, so stars and bounds can never contradict each other, whatever the method.
#   - data.table NSE: keep aggregations GForce-friendly (bare per-column sums), and never re-scan N
#     rows for a quantity the aggregate already carries.
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture (the inference layer).

#' Convert confidence levels into z thresholds
#'
#' @description Turn one or several confidence levels into the two-sided normal (z) thresholds they
#' correspond to, rounded for readability. It is a convenience for writing the \code{zscore} color
#' break scale (\code{\link{set_color_breaks}}) in the vocabulary you already use elsewhere —
#' confidence levels — instead of remembering that 95 % is 1.96. The scale itself always stores plain
#' z magnitudes, so \code{conf_level_to_z(0.95)} and \code{1.96} are strictly interchangeable.
#'
#' @param conf_level A numeric vector of confidence levels, each between 0 and 1
#'   (e.g. \code{c(0.95, 0.99)}).
#' @param digits Number of digits to round to (default 2). Rounding keeps color legends readable
#'   (\code{"+1.96"} rather than \code{"+1.959964"}); pass \code{Inf} for the exact values.

# === SECTION: whole-table tests (Chi2 + ANOVA), vectorised over all tables ============
#
# Whole-table omnibus tests for EVERY (sub)table in ONE pass over the already-aggregated cells -- never
# a raw N-scan. Tables are tagged by `table_id` and tested by grouped ops, so the cost is independent
# of the NUMBER of tables.
#
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - These engines are AGNOSTIC to weighting: they compute on whatever counts they are handed, and
#     the CALLER decides. chi2_compute_test() (R/tab-chi2.R) hands them the weighted counts rescaled
#     to the raw n; on unweighted data that factor is exactly 1.
#   - Chi2 must match stats::chisq.test() DEFAULTS EXACTLY, including the Yates continuity
#     correction on 2x2 (test-calculations.R locks it) -- which holds because of the rescale above.
#   - Welch's F must match stats::oneway.test(var.equal = FALSE); classic F must match
#     oneway.test(var.equal = TRUE). The F takes weighted group means/variances with an unweighted
#     n -- on unweighted data it reduces to oneway.test, which the parity test pins.

# `o` is the UNWEIGHTED n for the p-value, the weighted wn for the contribution pass. Parity with
# chisq.test(): empty rows/cols are dropped before df and Yates; Yates uses the per-cell
# pmin(0.5, |o-e|), which on a genuine 2x2 equals its scalar min(0.5, |o-E|); df < 1 yields pvalue = NA.
