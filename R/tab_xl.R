# PURPOSE: the Excel exporter -- values, number formats, colours and widths, through openxlsx2.
# ROLE: the format for sharing a table with people who do not use R, and the route into Word.
#   tab_xl_plan_one() does the pure per-table CPU (values + numFmt codes + a precomposed per-cell
#   style grid); xl_write_table() writes the values, applies the styles by id, then merges numFmt on.
#   It reads the shared prep (R/tab-export-prep.R) and reaches the engine only through
#   R/tab-xl-backend.R, which owns the openxlsx2 traps.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - EXCEL CANNOT PRINT A COMPOSITE CELL -- one value, one numFmt, so a bracket cannot survive.
#     Every ASIDE therefore becomes a COLUMN of its own (mat_aside_cols) carrying its own segment
#     ("(n={n})"), and the source column keeps its primary alone.
#   - THE CELL IS A NUMBER, and everything the template writes around it lives in the numFmt code:
#     the stars, an aside's brackets, a test label, a sigma. WARNING: xl_fold_literals() folds them
#     into EVERY SECTION (xl_numfmt_affix), or a two-section code wears its stars on the negative
#     half alone.
#   - A MULTIPLICATIVE CELL HOLDS ITS READING VALUE (fmt_excel_value: the signed fold), printed by a
#     two-section code, so "1/2.11" reaches the workbook without costing the cell its numeric type.
#     `ratio_cells = "raw"` / `"text"` opt out; ?tab_xl gives the formula that recovers the ratio.
#   - TEXT IS A PROPERTY OF A CELL, not of a column: a `{ci}` bracket or a real min-max `{n_range}`
#     is written individually into an otherwise numeric column, so a statistic beside it stays a
#     number and takes the reader's own decimal separator.
#   - COLOUR IS READ, NEVER RE-DERIVED: ann$font / ann$back / ann$face_* from the prep, the same
#     fields the html engine consumes, so a greyed cell is grey here too. An aside column is the
#     console's sec(): the secondary grey, no bold, no stars, whatever row it is in.
#   - format(x, syntax = "excel") is the ONE display source of truth (R/fmt_class.R). WARNING: a
#     numFmt literal is backslash-escaped (xl_numfmt_literal), NEVER double-quote-wrapped, which
#     crashes the older openxlsx2 that jamovi bundles.
#   - ONE WORKBOOK-SCOPED STYLE REGISTRAR (xl_style_registrar): openxlsx2's styles_mgr is
#     workbook-global and resolves a name to its FIRST match, so per-table name reuse applies table
#     one's styles to every later table. Each cell's full style is composed once and applied by id
#     over the fewest coalesced ranges.
#   - PROSE IS MERGED AND WRAPPED to about an A4 portrait width (xl_prose_span): a title or a legend
#     left in one narrow column is a paragraph in one cell, and an Excel -> Word paste then sizes
#     that column to the paragraph. WARNING: Excel does not auto-fit a MERGED cell's height, so the
#     row height is computed (xl_prose_height) or the legend is clipped to one line.
#   - COLUMN WIDTHS ARE MEASURED, ONE VECTOR PER SHEET (xl_col_widths -> xl_sheet_widths): a column
#     is as wide as the widest thing in it that CANNOT wrap (a figure), while everything that can (a
#     level header, a unit tag, a long label) contributes its width divided by the lines it may use.
#     Per sheet, because a column index belongs to the sheet and not to the table sitting on it.
#     WARNING: openxlsx2's `bestFit` is not usable -- it blanks merged ranges, ignores wrapText,
#     rotation and the per-cell font, and is sheet-scoped, so stacked tables overwrite each other.
#   - A SHAPE TABLE AND A CHECK PICTURE LIE OVER THE MAIN GRID, they do not join it: the shape table
#     merges its first column across the INDEX BLOCK (landing under the row labels) and two data
#     columns for each of the others, and neither touches the main table's own widths. ⚠ the gap
#     between two pictures is one constant (XL_CHECK_GAP, through xl_check_block) read by the
#     stacking budget AND by the writer, or the next table lands under a picture.
#   - The plan builder is pure; the workbook is assembled serially, the openxlsx2 write being
#     inherently so.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (exports and rendering); R/tab-export-prep.R (the
#      three header rows, tab_col_block_ids()); R/tab-xl-backend.R (the openxlsx2 traps).

#' Write a table to an Excel workbook
#' @description The Excel exporter behind \code{\link{tab_export}}: `tab_export(x, format = "xl")`
#' calls this. Colours follow the same palettes as the console and the HTML output, so a table looks
#' the same wherever it is read; change them with \code{\link{set_color_style}} and
#' \code{\link{set_color_breaks}}.
#' @eval tab_args_rd("tab_xl")
#' @param path,replace,open The name, and possibly the path, of the Excel file to create (the
#' \code{.xlsx} extension is optional). Defaults to a temporary directory; set the global option
#' \code{"tabxplor.export_dir"} with \code{\link[base]{options}} to change it. \code{replace}
#' defaults to \code{TRUE} when \code{path} is given and \code{FALSE} otherwise; set it to
#' \code{TRUE} to overwrite an existing file. Use \code{open = FALSE} not to open the workbook
#' straight away in Excel (or whatever opens \code{.xlsx} files).
#' @param colnames_rotation Rotate the names of columns to an angle (in degrees).
#' @param remove_tab_vars By default, \code{tab_vars} columns are removed to gain space --- the
#'   sub-table's Total row names it. Ignored where several \code{row_vars} are stacked: the level
#'   column alone is then not a complete row index, so the column stays.
#' Set to \code{FALSE} to keep them.
#' @param colwidth Column widths. \code{"auto"} (the default) fits every column to what its cells
#'   actually show, so a number column is exactly as wide as its widest figure and a text column
#'   wraps instead of growing past a cap. Give a number instead to force that fixed width on every
#'   numeric column (a mean's \code{sd} sibling then takes a proportionally narrower one).
#'   Widths are set per \emph{sheet}, so several tables written to one sheet all fit.
#' @param check Model-check plots to draw under each `tab_reg()` table: `FALSE` (the default),
#'   `"auto"`, or a vector of check keys --- the same values \code{\link{reg_check_plots}} takes,
#'   which is what draws them. Each grid is written as a picture below the table it belongs to.
#'   Needs `ggplot2` and `gridExtra`; a crosstab takes none.
#' @param data The data frame the models were fitted on. Only needed when `check` is on AND the
#'   \code{\link{tab_reg}} call cannot be replayed from the name it was written with (a `%>%`
#'   pipeline, a subset expression) --- an ordinary `tab_reg(gss, ...)` recovers it by itself.
#' @param ratio_cells What a ratio / odds-ratio cell holds in the workbook. Excel cannot compute
#'   inside a number format, so a cell storing `0.83` cannot be made to print `÷1.2` the way the
#'   console does. `"fold"` (the default) stores the **reading value** instead --- the fold, signed by
#'   its direction (`x` at or above the neutral, `-1/x` below it) --- which prints as `×1.20` and
#'   `÷1.20`, `2.11` and `1/2.11`. The cell stays a real number: it sorts and filters in the
#'   direction it is read, and takes the reader's own decimal separator. `"raw"` stores the
#'   untransformed ratio (printed `×0.83`); `"text"` writes the exact display string, which reads
#'   perfectly but is no longer a number. Option twin: \code{tabxplor.xl_ratio_cells}.
#' @section Recovering the raw ratio in Excel:
#' A ratio or odds-ratio cell holds its **reading value**: the fold, signed by its direction. The sign
#' IS the marker --- negative means the cell reads `÷` (or `1/`) --- so one formula gives the raw
#' ratio back, with no macro and no add-in:
#'
#' \preformatted{  =IF(A2<0, -1/A2, A2)     the ratio itself
#'   =ABS(A2)                how many times, whichever way it goes
#' }
#'
#' Sorting and filtering need neither: the stored value is monotone in the direction it is read, so
#' "at least twice as likely" is `>2` and "at least twice as unlikely" is `<-2`. Use
#' `ratio_cells = "raw"` when the untransformed ratio matters more than the reading.
#'
#' @param titles The titles of the different tables, as a character vector. When missing
#'   titles are given based on the names of the variables.
#' @param caption A single caption; a shortcut that fills \code{titles} (an explicit \code{titles}
#'   still wins). Unified name across all exporters.
#' @param font_text,font_num,font_num_stars Fonts for text (labels, headers) and for numbers. The
#'   number font is chosen \strong{per table}: \code{font_num} (default \code{"DejaVu Sans"}) when the
#'   table shows no significance stars, and \code{font_num_stars} (default \code{"Cascadia Mono"}, a
#'   \strong{monospace} font) when it does --- monospace aligns the stars and \code{(n=...)}
#'   composites, which a proportional font cannot. Defaults from
#'   \code{options(tabxplor.xl_font_text)} / \code{options(tabxplor.xl_font_num)} /
#'   \code{options(tabxplor.xl_font_num_stars)}. Note that xlsx, unlike CSS, has \strong{no
#'   font-fallback list}: only one name is recorded, so if it is missing on the machine opening the
#'   workbook Excel substitutes by its own rules. Set the options to a font you know is installed.
#' @param text_size,text_size_headers,text_size_subtext Font sizes of text elements.
#' @param theme By default (\code{"light"}) a white table with black text; set to \code{"dark"}
#'   for a black table with white text (the colours follow the theme).
#'   The black-and-white **publication** palettes render a table for a page that has no colour:
#'   \code{"print_ready"} picks the right one per table, or name it yourself --
#'   \code{"print_marks"}, \code{"print_emphasis"}, \code{"print_minimalistic"} (\code{"bw"}).
#'   See \code{\link{tab_css}} for what each of them says.
#' @param print_color_legend `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` Renamed to \code{color_legend}.
#' @param sheets The Excel sheets options :
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{"tabs"}: a new sheet is created for each table
#'   \item \code{"unique"}: all tables are on the same sheet
#'   \item \code{"auto"}: subsequent tables with the same column vars are printed on the
#'    same sheets
#' }
#' @param ... Retired arguments, accepted and ignored with a deprecation message since 2.0.0
#'   (`color_type`, `html_24_bit`, `n_min`, `hide_near_zero`): colour is a channel of `color =`,
#'   Excel is always 24-bit, and the other two are `tab()`'s business --- the small-base filter and
#'   the display template.
#'   Anything else is an error naming the argument you meant, as it already was in [tab()].
#'
#' @return  The table(s) with formatting and colors in an Excel file, as a side effect.
#'  Invisibly returns \code{tabs}.

# === SECTION: column widths -- ONE vector, measured from what the cell will show ===================
# Excel's width unit is one character of the workbook base font (xlb_base_font); format() renders
# the exact strings Excel shows, so nothing beyond the render model is needed to measure a column --
# unlike openxlsx2's own `bestFit` (see the header for why it can't be trusted).
#
# MEASURED IN THE INK THE CELL IS DRAWN IN, which is three facts and not one: the base font sets the
# width UNIT, the figures are drawn in `font_num` (XL_NUM_RATIO), and a bold cell is wider again
# (XL_BOLD_RATIO), per CELL because the Total row is bold and spans every column. A figure cannot
# wrap, so it sizes its column; a header, a unit tag or a label contributes its width divided by the
# lines it may use. Measured per SHEET (xl_sheet_widths): a column index belongs to the sheet.

# XL_PAD is the cell's left+right padding, ~5px = 0.7 characters, rounded up to a comfortable 1.

# which xlb_base_font() sets to the TEXT font (a condensed sans); numbers are drawn in `font_num` --
# measured at the default 10pt, an 8px digit against the base's 7px, in the plain stack AND in the
# monospace one a starred table switches to. So the ratio is a property of every figure column, not
# of stars: the old `has_stars` gate over-provisioned the starred path and left the plain one 14 %
# short, which is why a bare "100%" Total column printed "#####" with no bold in sight.
XL_NUM_RATIO <- 1.15
# ...and BOLD, measured per cell on the same stack: "0%" 20 -> 22 px, "100%" 36 -> 40, "21 483"
# 44 -> 50. The digits are tabular and do not move; it is "%", "." and the thousands mark that grow,
# which is why the SHORT columns were the ones that failed. Per CELL and never per column: the Total
# row is bold and spans every column, so a column-level factor would tax the whole sheet.
