# PURPOSE: THE argument surface as data.
# ROLE: an argument of a crosstab producer is declared ONCE -- which producers take it, what it may
#   be, which option is its default, and what it means -- and the signature, the reference page and
#   the value list all read that declaration. TAB_ARGS covers the producers; EXPORT_ARGS is its twin
#   for the render surface.
# DESIGN -- THE RULE, and it is what keeps this table from swallowing the fact tables:
#     *** THE FACT TABLE OWNS THE VOCABULARY. TAB_ARGS OWNS THE ARGUMENT. ***
#   MEASURES knows what `difference` is; TAB_ARGS knows that `color` is an argument of four
#   producers, that it names a measure, and how to say so in a help page. `values_rd` is the edge
#   between them, checked at load in R/zzz-fact-keys.R. An argument whose vocabulary has no other
#   home -- `na`, `tot`, `levels`, `totaltab`, `comp`, `pct` -- declares it HERE, in `values`, which
#   is why TAB_ARG_VALUES is derived from this table rather than living beside it.
# DESIGN: `doc` IS the roxygen text -- and it is a REFERENCE entry, not a lesson: what the argument
#   is, its values, at most one sentence on when to change it. Teaching goes in the vignettes, which
#   the prose links to once per page. Rendered by tab_args_rd(), which orders by formals() and
#   ASSERTS that the declared set and the formals are the same set -- so an argument added to a
#   signature without a row breaks the build. `doc_in_producer = TRUE` says the prose stays in the
#   producer's own roxygen. tab_reg() declares all 25 of its formals here, so tx_check_tab_args()
#   polices its signature exactly as it polices a crosstab one -- but it does NOT get
#   @eval tab_args_rd(): the two producers share the NAME and the GRAMMAR of `wt` / `ref` / `na` /
#   `display` / `color` / `ci_method` / `tab_vars` / `conf_level` / `data`, and not the PROSE. Every
#   one of those reads differently on a model, and emitting the crosstab text into ?tab_reg would be
#   WRONG documentation, not deduplicated documentation.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - There is deliberately NO `group` column: ordering by formals() matches \usage{} and is
#     self-checking, which left `group` with no reader. Add it the day something groups by it.
#   - ⚠ `status` may be a NAMED vector when an argument is deprecated on ONE producer and live on
#     another (`row_var` is a deprecated alias on tab() and the real formal of the leaves). Read it
#     with tab_arg_status(name, producer), never with `$status`.
#   - EXPORT_ARGS is a separate table rather than more rows: `color`, `subtext` and `stars` mean
#     something structurally different on an exporter than on a producer. Its own scope rule is
#     stated at the table.
#   - This file sorts before tab.R, so nothing here may read tab.R's top-level objects at SOURCE
#     time. Everything below is a literal or a function body.
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture (the declarative architecture); R/tab-options.R (the option
#   twins this table's `option` column points at).

# COLUMNS. `producers` is the only one every row carries; everything else states what is unusual
# about the argument. Every row writes them in TAB_ARG_ORDER -- short facts first, `doc` last -- so
# the 81 rows read down a column; asserted at load.
#   producers   the producers this is a FORMAL of. tab_args_rd() orders by formals() and asserts the
#               two sets match, so a signature and this table cannot drift.
#   dots        the producers that take it through `...` instead of as a formal.
#   status      "deprecated" / "superseded". ⚠ may be a NAMED vector, one entry per producer -- read
#               it with tab_arg_status(name, producer), never with `$status`.
#   default     the formal's default; `default_for` overrides it per producer (a named list).
#   option      the tabxplor.* option that supplies the default when the formal is NULL (a
#               TAB_OPTIONS key, checked at load).
#   values      the argument's OWN value set, for an argument no fact table gives a vocabulary to.
#   values_from the fact table that owns the vocabulary instead (checked at load).
#   values_rd   the *_rd() generator that renders the value list into the help page.
#   validate    FALSE = declared for the documentation only, never checked at the boundary.
#   leaf        the narrower value set the LEAF producers accept, where the full one is wider.
#   size        the exact length the value must have (absent = any).
#   na_ok       NA is a legal value.
#   check       the numeric contract the value must meet: "probability" | "count".
#   stored      `pct` only: the PCT_TYPES key stamped when the argument is off.
#   doc         the roxygen @param body, as Rd lines. `doc_for` overrides it per producer;
#               `doc_with` says another row's block documents this one; `doc_in_producer = TRUE`
#               that the prose stays in the producer's own roxygen.
# The one order every row of both tables writes its fields in, asserted below.

# --- EXPORT_ARGS: the RENDER surface ---------------------------------------------------------------
# The exporters' half of the argument surface, a separate table because `color` / `subtext` /
#   `stars` mean something ELSE on an exporter (a logical switch) than on a producer -- a shared
#   key cannot hold both rows.
# DESIGN -- the scope rule (narrower than TAB_ARGS'): a row exists only when shared by >= 2
#   exporters, or is the per-call twin of an option with no TAB_ARGS row of its own. Most rows
#   carry no `doc` here even though shared, because the ACCEPTED VALUES differ by backend
#   (`theme`'s "auto" exists only where a stylesheet ships) -- differing value sets are not a
#   duplicate, so the prose stays with `doc_in_producer = TRUE`.
# COLUMNS: the same as TAB_ARGS' -- `producers`, `option`, `doc` / `doc_for` / `doc_with` /
#   `doc_in_producer` -- minus every validation one: an exporter's value set is its backend's, so no
