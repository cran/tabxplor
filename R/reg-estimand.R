# PURPOSE: WHAT A REGRESSION COLUMN ESTIMATES -- one COMPOSED library answering the user's three
#   questions at once.
#
#     link    = which measure the MODEL estimates   ("odds_ratio" | "ratio" | "difference")
#     measure = which measure is REPORTED           (the same words, plus "raw_coefficient")
#     effect  = where the number comes from         ("conditional" | "marginal" | "at_reference")
#
# THE RULE EVERYTHING HERE DERIVES FROM. A LINK IS A MEASURE -- the one a model estimates directly --
# so the argument that names the model takes the same words as the argument that names the report,
# and the statistician's vocabulary never surfaces:
#
#     difference <-> identity        ratio <-> log        odds_ratio <-> logit
#
# and a RAW COEFFICIENT exists only where the two agree -- and only as the model's OWN number, i.e.
# `effect = "conditional"`: there is no marginal coefficient, and asking for one says so. Otherwise the measure is applied to the model's
# PREDICTIONS, averaged over the sample or read at one profile. Those are the only glm links whose
# coefficient names a measure of deviation -- probit, cauchit, sqrt and inverse name none, which is
# exactly why such models are reported through marginal effects.
#
# THE CASCADE. `"auto"` means FOLLOW FROM THE LEFT: family -> link -> measure -> effect. Set any one
# and everything to its right re-derives. ONE clause qualifies it, and it is the only place an
# argument reads one to its right: `"auto"` never resolves to a PREDICTED odds ratio. A marginal
# odds ratio is a specialist quantity (Karlson & Jann 2023), so it is asked for by name; auto falls
# back to the LEVEL's own measure, which for a percentage is "x times as likely".
#
# WHAT A LEVEL IS decides which measures exist at all, and an ORDERED outcome's level is a RANK --
# compared by pairs of people rather than by shares, which is what lets it report in ONE column.
# REG_LEVEL_MEASURES holds that vocabulary and the reason it is not a `var_kind`.
#
# THE LIBRARY IS COMPOSED, NEVER WRITTEN. reg_compose_library() emits one row per BUILDABLE
# (link, effect, measure) from four facts a family declares -- `level`, `fits`, `words`, `note` --
# and two shared maps (REG_MEASURE_LINK, REG_LEVEL_MEASURES). So adding a family is one REG_FAMILIES
# row and adding a link one map entry, and a family CANNOT declare a scale, a header word and a
# crude shape that disagree with each other, because it declares none of the three.
#
# THE STATES a user must be able to tell apart. A row in the table -> build it. No row -> one of four
# refusals, DERIVED from the clause that failed rather than declared: `impossible` (the level has no
# such measure -- an odds ratio of a continuous outcome is not a thing, whatever anyone implements),
# `no_link` (tabxplor fits no such model here), `no_coefficient` (the model estimates something else,
# so name the two cures), `not_offered` (a hole, with what IS offered enumerated from the table). A
# fifth exists only at run time: the fit that did not converge (reg_fit()).
#
# THE HEADER VOCABULARY is here too (REG_WORDS + REG_CONTRASTS). One name per quantity: a header
# names the MEASURE and the CONTRAST is a marker on it, so the varying part of a column name is one
# acronym a reader can look up. The word is COMPOSED (marker o log-wrap o base acronym), never
# declared -- which is what makes it impossible for two estimands to share a header, or for one
# estimand to be named two ways.
#
# FIVE CONSUMERS, ONE TABLE, and never a second hand-written list: the boundary resolver
# (reg_estimand()), the abort (reg_estimand_abort()), the user-callable lister (reg_measures()), the
# generated ?tab_reg sections and jamovi's eligibility rule (reg_estimands_for() / reg_words_rd()),
# and the "Model:" footer line (reg_estimand_note()).
#
# ALSO HERE: REG_FAMILIES -- what each model family is CALLED, what it fits and where it may be
# named, so the footer sentence, the Excel filename tag and the two jamovi picker labels cannot
# disagree; `ui = NA` IS the fact "not offered in the picker", and declaring no `fits` IS the fact
# "not a user family".
#
# WARNING -- i18n: every user-visible string in these tables (`long`, `why`, `note`) is a BARE MSGID,
# gettext()'d by its reader at render. A top-level gettext() would evaluate once at load and freeze
# the build locale, making the language switch a no-op.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the regression subsystem).


# --- the measure vocabulary --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THREE base geometries + `raw_coefficient`, which is NOT a peer: it is the model's own coefficient,
# the fit un-transformed. A precise spelling (`log_odds` / `log_risk` / `log_rate`) additionally PINS
# which base. ⚠ It is TOTAL: on a link that already is additive (identity) there is nothing to
# un-exponentiate, so it resolves to the additive row itself -- see reg_estimand()'s fall-through.
# ⚠ And it is CONDITIONAL-ONLY: a raw coefficient is the fit's own, so there is no such thing as a
# marginal one -- reg_compose_log() emits a log twin of the conditional rows alone.
#
# THE ACRONYMS ARE NOT DECLARED HERE. They are MEASURE_ACRONYMS (R/fmt_class.R), the one table every
# argument that names a measure reads, so `tab(color = "RR")` and `tab_reg(measure = "RR")` cannot
# answer differently. This is the REGRESSION VIEW of it: the same acronyms, plus the three a model
# alone estimates (MEASURE_ACRONYMS_REG), plus the `log*` family and the cascade's `auto` -- the two
# things a crosstab has no use for. Composed, never listed, so a spelling exists once.
# ⚠ Case-sensitive, and deliberately: `Difference` / `ODDS_RATIO` / `Rom` are not spellings anyone
#   should be taught, and a tolower() fallback made them legal for free.

# REG_CELL_DIGITS -- how many decimals a REGRESSION cell prints, per estimate scale. ONE declaration,
# read by every builder, because the crude and model columns of one comparison must print the same
# quantity to the same precision.
#
# It is the LEVEL's precision, not the estimate's: a token too coarse at 0 raises itself through
# DISPLAY_TOKENS$min_digits.
# THE DECLARED NUMBER IS A MID-RANGE DEFAULT. On a UNIT scale -- one whose level is in the outcome's
# own units, i.e. whose level token is `mean` -- it cannot be more, a salary being six figures and a
# rate two, so `level_mag` (the spec's own reading of the outcome) clamps it to 3 significant
# figures: 101 002.4 was one decimal of noise. A FIXED scale (a percentage, a point, a ratio, an odds
# ratio) lives in a known range and keeps its declared number untouched. The upper edge is stated
# once, in tx_sig_digits() / fmt_magnitude_cap() (R/fmt_class.R), which also stops format()'s own
# floors from claiming the decimal back.
# ⚠ IT IS THE LEVEL'S, so on a scale whose ESTIMATE needs more than its level does it must not be
# read as the estimate's: in format() a 0 means "unset" and is what lets a token's own minimum
# apply, while a 1 SILENCES it -- which is how `score_ratio` printed x1.4 where the `ratio` token
# asks for x1.44. Those scales state the estimate's precision separately (EST_SCALES$est_digits),

# A measure exists for an outcome when the outcome's LEVEL can be transformed by that measure's link:
# a PERCENTAGE has an identity, a log and a logit, so all three; a MEAN or a COUNT has no odds, so no
# odds ratio.
#
# ⚠ A LEVEL KIND IS NOT A `var_kind`. The two coincided while every level was a number a cell holds
# (pct / mean / count, EST_SCALES' own words), and `rank` is where they part: it asks WHICH MEASURES
# EXIST, while a var_kind says how a number formats and colours. A rank's two measures are stamped
# with ordinary `points` / `pct_ratio` scales, so nothing downstream learns a fourth var_kind.
#
# A RANK is what an ORDERED outcome's cell is: not a share of one category but a share of PAIRS. Of
# two people, one from this group and one from the reference group, who ends up higher? That pair --
# (win, loss) -- has the same two readings as a level and its reference, additive and multiplicative,
# and it is the exact K-category generalisation of a binary outcome's own measures: at K = 2,
# win - loss IS the risk difference and win / loss IS the odds ratio. It carries no `at_reference`
# row (reg_compose_row()) because a pair drawn at one profile is a different, matched estimand.
#
# Each cell names the EST_SCALES row the column is stamped with and the base acronym its header
# prints. ⚠ ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: the first entry is the LEVEL'S OWN measure, which is what the
# cascade's one clause falls back to rather than marginalise a non-collapsible link.

# REG_FAMILIES -- WHAT EACH MODEL FAMILY IS, what it can FIT and where it may be NAMED. Every other
# name table (reg_family_display_name(), reg_family_short(), the UI labels) is DERIVED from this one,
# and so is the whole estimand library -- so adding a family is one row.
#
# Every row writes its fields in ONE order -- display, short, ui, ui_binary, outcome, outcome_level,
# level, fits, words, odds_pred, crude, note, why -- so the families read down a column. They are
# grouped below by what they are FOR, not by that order.
#
# The estimand columns, which are what the library composes from:
#   level      what a cell of this outcome IS: "pct" | "mean" | "count" | "rank". It decides which
#              measures exist (REG_LEVEL_MEASURES) and which is the level's own. Declaring it (with
#              `fits`) IS the fact "a user family". ⚠ NOT a var_kind: the first three happen to
#              share EST_SCALES' words, "rank" does not -- see REG_LEVEL_MEASURES.
#   fits       THE VALUE SET OF `link`, measure-keyed, mapping to the internal fit key reg_fit()
#              takes. ⚠ ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: the first entry is the family's own link, which is
#              what `link = "auto"` resolves to and what the default table shows.
#   words      per-measure header override, or NULL. Only ordinal declares one: a cumulative odds
#              ratio is not a plain one, and the header says so.
#   note       the QUALIFIER clause of the "Model:" footer line on a COEFFICIENT row -- what the
#              estimand is measured against. The prediction routes generate their own.
#   odds_pred  HOW a PREDICTED odds ratio is defined here, or NA. "complement" = the level and its
#              complement, so both prediction routes offer it (a binary outcome). "vsrest" = only at
#              a profile, each category versus the rest -- the `vsrest` builder, which is the one
#              answer a 3+ category outcome has to "versus what?".
#   crude      the REG_EMPIRICAL block this family's observed cells come from, when it is not its
#              own name. Only quasipoisson needs it: it differs from poisson in the VARIANCE
#              assumption, not in what it estimates.
#
# The naming columns:
#   display    a CLOSURE -- gettext() at render (so the footer follows options(tabxplor.lang)) while
#              staying statically extractable by potools. The CI_METHOD_LABELS precedent.
#   short      the filename tag (Excel sheet names).
#   ui         the PICKER label, or NA. ⚠ `NA` IS THE FACT "not offered in the picker".
#   ui_binary  the picker label OVERRIDE on a 2-level outcome.
#   outcome    NA on a user family; on an internal LINK key (rr / rd / mr), the OUTCOME family it
#              belongs to. REG_FIT_FAMILY is derived from this column.
#   outcome_level  WHAT `outcome_level = c(<outcome> = "<level>")` MEANS FOR THIS FAMILY, and the one
#              non-uniformity in the argument -- forced by arithmetic, not by taste, so it is
#              declared once here rather than written twice in prose:
#                "modelled"  with TWO levels, singling one out IS choosing what is estimated (the
#                            other becomes the baseline automatically), and the chosen level is the
#                            column header. binomial.
#                "baseline"  with k > 2 you can only choose the PIVOT, so the named level is the
#                            category every other column is compared to -- the opposite role.
#                            multinomial.
#                NA          the outcome has no level to choose. `why` says which kind of "no":
#                            an ordinal outcome HAS levels but must keep their order, and a numeric
#                            one has none at all. NA + a `why` closure IS the refusal.
#   why        the reason `outcome_level` is refused, a gettext closure, or NULL for the generic
#              "this family models no level" message.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: `ui` is emitted into the generated jamovi JS in declaration order.

# --- the library, COMPOSED ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ONE ROW per (link, effect, measure) the package can BUILD. A refusal is NOT a row: reg_estimand()
# derives it from the clause that failed, so a hole and its reason cannot drift apart.
#
# The composed members, and where each comes from:
#
#   link          which measure the MODEL estimates -- the key into the family's `fits`.
#   effect        the contrast: "conditional" | "marginal" | "at_reference".
#   measure       what is REPORTED; "raw_coefficient" on a logged row, whose base is `base_measure`.
#   base_measure  the measure a logged row is the log OF (itself, on every other row). It is the
#                 LOOKUP key: under one (link, effect) a ratio and an odds ratio both log, so
#                 "raw_coefficient" alone would name two rows.
#   measure_link  the link the REPORTED comparison is taken on -- REG_EMPIRICAL$*$link's own
#                 vocabulary, and what the g-computation sweep and the crude leg both read. It
#                 EQUALS the model's link exactly on a coefficient row.
#   builder       which of reg_build()'s three column builders runs: "coef" | "ame" | "vsrest".
#   fit           the internal family key handed to reg_fit(), i.e. `fits[[link]]`. It is where a
#                 link becomes a different MODEL: "rr" = modified Poisson (a conditional risk
#                 ratio), "rd" = identity link (a risk difference), "mr" = log-link pseudo-ML.
#   exp           exponentiate the tidy estimate: multiplicative, and not logged.
#   word          the BASE measure acronym, a key into REG_WORDS. The contrast marker and the log
#                 wrapper are composed onto it by reg_word(), never declared.
#   scale         the EST_SCALES key stamped on the column. Its `est_field` says which fmt field
#                 the estimate is written into, so a scale change needs no builder change.
#   crude_fam     which REG_EMPIRICAL block the observed companion comes from; "auto" =
#                 reg_crude_key(fit, trials), which is what carries `trials` -> grouped_binomial.
#   crude_shape   which shape row inside it: the block's shape on `measure_link`.
#   comparison    the marginaleffects `comparison =` value (NA = the additive default).
#   note          a closure returning the QUALIFIER clause of the "Model:" footer line -- what the
#                 estimand is measured against, and any assumption worth one phrase. The measure
#                 itself is not repeated: the footer composes "<word> = <long> (<note>)".
#   log_of        on a logged row, the scale it is the log OF. `log_coef` is one row shared by every
#                 logged measure, so a link-scale column cannot say on its own whether its
#                 exponential is an odds or a level -- and its baseline row differs by exactly that.
#   status        "ok". Every row in this table builds; that is what makes it a table of rows.

# --- consumer 3: the lister the user can call on their own outcome -----------------------------------

#' What can this outcome be modelled as?
#'
#' Lists what [tab_reg()] can report for one outcome: which models it could fit, and which measure
#' of deviation each of them yields. It reads the same runtime table the argument validator and the
#' error messages read, so what it prints is what the function does. The section below is the same
#' table for every kind of outcome, read without any data.
#'
#' **The table has two blocks**, because the grid factors:
#' * one row per model you could fit — its **`link`**, and the measure that model's own coefficients
#'   carry (`effect = "conditional"`);
#' * then the measures read off the model's **predictions**, which are the same whichever model you
#'   fit — `link` reads `"(any)"` there.
#'
#' So `link` is the choice that matters, and it decides only which measure comes with a
#' *coefficient*: everything else is available from any of them.
#'
#' By default only each family's **own** model is listed — the one it fits unless told otherwise.
#' `link = "all"` adds the others, which are specialist choices, and marks the family's own with
#' `base_link`.
#'
#' Only what can be built is listed. A measure this kind of outcome does not have simply has no row,
#' and the message says why (an odds ratio needs a probability to take the odds of). One state exists
#' only at run time: a link that does not converge on your data. `tab_reg()` says so and, for the
#' risk difference, falls back to the linear probability model.
#'
#' @param data A data frame (or a `survey` design), as for [tab_reg()].
#' @param outcome The outcome column name.
#' @param family The model family. `"auto"` (default) lists every family this kind of outcome can
#'   take, the detected one first — which is the choice to make before the others.
#' @param link Which measure the model estimates. `"auto"` (default) reads the table at each family's
#'   own model; `"all"` adds every other link it fits; name one to read it at that model alone.
#'
#' @return A tibble of `family` (only when several are listed), `link`, `measure`, `effect`,
#'   `header` (the column name it would produce) and `reads_as` (what that header's acronym means).
#'   With `link = "all"`, a `base_link` column says which model is the family's own (`NA` on the
#'   prediction rows, which belong to no link in particular).
