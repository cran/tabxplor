# PURPOSE: the `a*b` entries of `tab(col_vars =)` -- a crossed pair prepared as COLUMNS.
# ROLE: the crosstab half of the interaction subsystem. Everything about what a cross IS lives in
#   R/reg-cross.R (the peel, the validation, the autocut, the two arms); this file says what each arm
#   MEANS on a column axis, and where in tab()'s pipeline it is materialised.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - THE SAME SPELLING AND THE SAME ARMS AS tab_reg(): `a*b`, `:` refused by name, REG_CROSS_ARMS.
#     A user who has met an interaction in one producer has met it in the other.
#   - a cross is PREPARED, never special-cased downstream: after materialisation every stage reads
#     ordinary col_vars, so the aggregate, the chi2/ANOVA, the intervals, the colour engine and every
#     exporter need no code of their own;
#   - an interaction is accepted in `col_vars` ONLY. The row and tab axes take no uncut number (so a
#     `nested` cross has nothing to nest), and two factors down the rows are what `tab_vars` is;
#   - the internal column names are SYNTACTIC; the typed key is the DISPLAY identity (`col_var`).
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the crosstab API and pipeline).
#
# THE TWO ARMS, read as columns (REG_CROSS_ARMS, R/reg-cross.R):
#
#   cells   both parents categorical -> ONE materialised factor whose levels are the observed cells,
#           so the block is one column per cell. Both parents are absorbed, exactly as they are in a
#           model: `keeps = character(0)`.
#   nested  the modified parent continuous -> ONE MEAN COLUMN PER MODERATOR LEVEL, and the moderator
#           keeps its own block beside them (`keeps = "moderator"`). It is the column reading of the
#           model's "one slope within each level of M": here, one mean within each level of M.
#
# ⚠ WHY THE NESTED ARM IS MATERIALISED LATE. Its columns are named by the moderator's LEVELS, and a
# moderator that `shape` will cut has no levels until the cut has run -- which happens in
# tab_prepare_pop(), after the filter and the NA policy, so the breaks describe the population
# actually tabulated. So the boundary puts ONE placeholder column in `col_vars` (a numeric copy of
# the modified variable) and tab_prepare_pop() expands it, completing the settings spine exactly as
# it already completes it with `lv1` and `na`.
