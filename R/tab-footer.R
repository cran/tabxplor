# PURPOSE: the REGION under a table -- what appears there, in what order, in every medium.
# ROLE: the third part of what a table says about itself. R/fmt_class.R declares the colour MEASURES,
#   R/tab-legend.R turns them into a sentence, and this file decides what is printed beneath the grid
#   and where: the weight line, the `Model:` lines, the colour legend, the significance-stars key, the
#   user's own notes, and the tables and notes that travel under the whole block.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - FOOTER_BLOCKS is the region: one row per member, ROW ORDER IS READING ORDER, and a row is GATED
#     BY WHAT IT READS -- which is also the degradation contract. A table stripped of its metadata
#     keeps the column-derived half of its footer (the colour legend, the stars key) and drops the
#     rest, with no exception handling anywhere.
#   - THE TEXT IS A TEMPLATE THE TABLE CARRIES: `subtext`, written by the producers, holds one
#     `<placeholder>` per generated line and one line per thing a person wrote, IN PRINTING ORDER.
#     ⚠ A subtext naming no placeholder is APPENDED to the default instead -- the rule that keeps a
#     bare note, a raw `attr(x, "subtext") <-` and jamovi's free-text box working -- and an unknown
#     `<...>` is TEXT, claiming nothing: html escapes every footer token, so no markup is ever run.
#   - AND IT NAMES WHAT *THIS* TABLE CAN SAY (the `default` column): a member built from `meta` is
#     named only where its fact exists, one built from the COLUMNS always. So the two gates answer
#     different questions -- `reads` decides what a stripped table still prints, `default` what the
#     producers write down -- and a predicate may over-name but must never under-name.
#     ⚠ Written at each PRODUCER'S TAIL, on the finished object: a regression's model record is
#     attached after the table is assembled (set_reg_call()), so anything earlier prunes <model>.
#   - A generated member belongs to the HOST (the `carried` column): a subordinate table renders what
#     it carries and nothing else, so a host + subordinate pair shows ONE colour legend.
#   - ⚠ In the CONSOLE a note and a subordinate table print ABOVE the grid, because the last thing
#     printed is the R object you can go on to pipe; in an export they read below the footer.
#   - Every footer line is a TOKEN STREAM, so a plain one-liner is a 1-token stream and one renderer
#     (render_footer) covers the whole region. `role` only picks the console's subtle prefix.
#   - Composed at RENDER, like the legend it carries: see R/tab-legend.R's header and
#     dev/legend_and_side_tables.md section 3.
#   - THE EMITTER MATRIX -- three kinds, five media, and every emitter already existed:
#       line   legend_render_line(medium = "console" | "md" | "html" | "runs" | "plain")
#       note   the pipe-table renderer (console + md) / note_html() / note_xl()
#       tab    tab_pipe() (console) / the exporters' `list_method = TRUE` path
# See: dev/legend_and_side_tables.md; CLAUDE.md section "Exports and rendering".

# the legend style for EXPORTS (md / html / Excel). Default "prose"; options(tabxplor.legend_style =
# "terse") gives the compact one-liner. The console always uses "terse". Any value but "terse" -> "prose".

# ---- THE GRID -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One row per member of the region below a table, and ROW ORDER IS READING ORDER -- the same shape
# TOOLTIP_LINES gives the hover. Adding a member is one row.
#   key      the row's name.
#   token    the `<placeholder>` a subtext template places it by, or NA for a member that is not text
#            and needs none: carrying its `reads` fact is what prints it, as for the test rows.
#   kind     "line" (a token stream, under the table in every medium) | "note" (a grid of rendered
#            character columns) | "tab" (a tabxplor_tab). See the emitter matrix in the file header.
#   role     render_footer()'s console subtle key; NA where the kind is not a line.
#   reads    WHICH FACTS this member is built from -- `meta$...` fields and `fmt` column attributes.
#            It is the row's gate, its degradation contract, and (through TAB_ATTRS' setters) the
#            source of ?tabxplor-footer's "to change what this says, use..." column.
#   carried  is this member CARRIED by the table (the user's own lines, the subordinate tables) rather
#            than GENERATED from it? A generated member belongs to the HOST: a subordinate table is not
#            a peer, so it renders what it carries and nothing else, which is what keeps one colour
#            legend under a host + subordinate pair instead of two.
#   build    closure(x, ctx) -> a list of token streams. NULL where the kind is not a line.
#   default  closure(x) -> is this member part of THIS TABLE'S OWN template? Absent = always named.
#            It answers a DIFFERENT question from `reads`: `reads` is the RENDER gate (a fact that is
#            gone prints nothing), this is the TEMPLATE gate (what the producers write down). So it
#            tests only what the BUILD settles and no setter can add later -- a weight, a model, an
#            interaction -- while everything derived from the COLUMNS stays named unconditionally,
#            since set_color() can colour an uncoloured table afterwards.
#            ⚠ It may OVER-name (the builder then prints nothing, and the reader deletes a line that
#            says nothing) but must NEVER under-name: a placeholder the producers omit is one nothing
#            brings back. ⚠ The predicates are CLOSURES, not bare symbols: this table is folded at
#            source time, before R/table-spec.R and R/tab_reg.R exist (the TAB_ATTRS `spec` precedent).

# ⚠ Only a BLOCK placeholder alone on its line claims the layout. An INLINE one (`<breaks>`, `<conf>`)
#   is substitution, so quoting the confidence level in a note cannot cost its writer the footer.
# ⚠ An unknown `<...>` is not a placeholder: it prints as TEXT and claims nothing (html escapes it,
#   see legend_render_line()), so a typo shows itself instead of hiding a block, and markup written
#   in a note is shown, never run. `\<` escapes a literal `<` that would otherwise read as one.

# a `<token>` or `<token:arg:arg>`, the token lowercase-alphanumeric. Deliberately narrow: "n < 30"

#' A note under a table
#'
#' @description

#' glossary, a range, a set of diagnostics --- something that belongs to the table without being a row
#' of it. Attach it with \code{\link{set_footer_tabs}}, beside (or instead of) a real table.
#'
#' A plain \code{data.frame} passed to \code{set_footer_tabs()} already renders as a note, its own
#' names as headers, everything left-aligned. \code{tab_note()} is for when that is not enough.
#'
#' @param df A data.frame of character columns, already formatted.
#' @param headers Column titles; defaults to \code{names(df)}.
#' @param align One of \code{"left"} / \code{"right"} per column; defaults to all left.
#' @param grey One logical per row: a row to render in the dimmer aside ink (a result the note itself
#'   marks as not to be read). \code{NULL} for none.
#' @param note One or more lines printed under the grid, smaller still --- what a cell cannot say for
#'   itself.
#' @param kind Per column, \code{"text"} (default) or \code{"spark"}, a run of block glyphs the html
#'   backend upgrades to an inline \code{<svg>}.

#' The lines under a table
#'
#' @description
#' Everything \pkg{tabxplor} prints beneath a table --- the weight line, the `Model:` line, the
#' colour legend, the significance-stars key, and your own notes --- is **one template**, and the
#' template is the table's `subtext`. `get_subtext()` shows it, [set_subtext()] replaces it:
#'
#' ```
#' t <- tab(forcats::gss_cat, race, marital, pct = "row", color = "diff")
#' get_subtext(t)
#' #> "<legend>" "<stars>"
#' ```
#'
#' Everything generated is a `<placeholder>`; everything you write is a line; **the order of the
#' lines is the order of the footer**. Re-order them and it re-orders. Delete `<legend>` and no
#' colour legend is generated --- in the console too, which no exporter argument can reach.
#'
#' **A table names only what it can say.** The template above has no `<weight>` because the table is
#' unweighted and no `<model>` because it is not a regression --- both are settled when the table is
#' built and nothing can add them afterwards. `<legend>` and `<stars>` are always named: they are
#' built from the columns, which [set_color()] and the \pkg{dplyr} verbs can still change.
#'
#' @section The one rule:
#' A `subtext` naming **no** placeholder is simply appended to the default footer, which is what a
#' note has always done. Writing one placeholder on a line of its own takes the layout over: only
#' what you name is printed. An unknown `<...>` is not a placeholder --- raw html, `"n < 30"` and
#' `"<30 ans>"` pass through verbatim and claim nothing (`\<` escapes a literal `<`).
#'
#' @section What is built when:
#' Every placeholder is resolved **at render**, so a footer follows the `lang =`, the `theme =` and
#' the medium of the call that prints it, and a table edited after it was built (a `select()`, a
#' [set_display()], a [set_color_breaks()]) says the truth about what it now shows. Your own lines
#' are frozen in the language you wrote them --- the default template holds no prose, so nothing
#' mixes unless you write it.
#'
#' A table that has lost its attributes keeps what its **columns** can still say --- the colour
#' legend and the stars key --- and drops the rest.
#'
#' @eval footer_blocks_rd()
#'
#' @seealso [set_subtext()] to edit the template, [tab_footer_text()] to read what it prints,
#'   [set_legend_words()] to re-state what the legend calls a measure, [set_footer_tabs()] and
#'   [tab_note()] for a table or a note under the whole block, [tabxplor-options] for the
#'   session-wide defaults.
