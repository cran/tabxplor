# PURPOSE: EVERY palette tabxplor draws with, in one place -- the colour ramps, the chrome, and the
#   black-and-white publication palettes -- plus the store that keys them by (family, theme).
# ROLE: a palette answers one question: "slot 3 of the text channel, in this theme -- what does it
#   look like?" Everything upstream is theme-blind (the engine computes SLOTS, integers 0-8) and
#   everything downstream just draws what it is handed, so this file is the ONE boundary where a
#   number becomes an appearance. Read through get_color_style() / tx_chrome_hex(); written, for the
#   colour ramps only, by set_color_palette().
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - A palette is HEX **and** FACE. A backend must never derive "is this bold" from "does this have
#     a colour hex": that collapses on a publication palette whose every slot is near-black. The
#     face is declared beside the hex, always.
#   - A publication palette CANNOT be derived from a colour one: desaturating the two direction ramps
#     collapses them onto the same greyscale, so the direction is not degraded but GONE. Hence the
#     curated grids below -- and hence set_color_palette() provably cannot alter publication output.
#   - The working principle, in one line: an ORDERED channel (a colour ramp, an ink ladder, an
#     emphasis ladder, a repeated mark) carries MAGNITUDE; a SELECTIVE channel (hue, underline vs
#     italic, or the cell's own +/- symbol) carries DIRECTION.
#   - A palette's grid IS its definition. A colour rung's hex and its oklch coordinate, a print
#     slot's ink, weight, slant, rule and mark, sit on ONE ROW -- because the question a maintainer
#     asks is "what does break 2 look like", not "where is the italic list". Adding a palette, or
#     re-tuning a ramp, is one row and nothing else.
#   - The `oklch` column is how the ramps were chosen (chroma peaks, lightness steps, colour-blind
#     safety) and the only way to re-tune them. No code reads it; never drop it.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the colour system);
#      dev/colors.md, which holds the ladder derivations and the measurement the publication
#      palettes answer (the shipped ramps converted to CIE L*), neither of which a header can hold.

# === SECTION: the colour ramps -- 8-bit fallback, then the 24-bit OKLCH palettes ====================

## 24-BIT OKLCH PALETTES ----

# OKLCH Chroma Peaks
# - Blue            H265 / L45  ; H180 to 265
# - to Orange Red   H28 / L62   ; H90 to 28   (avoid true red ?)
#
# - Green           H142 / L86  ; H110 to H160
# - to Violet Red   H325 / L70  ; H285 to H25

# ⚠ THE TWO THEMES ARE NOT ONE PALETTE INVERTED, and the reason is the gamut, not taste. On white the
# CEILING supplies the ladder -- cyan holds only 0.113 at L 0.66 while violet holds 0.304 at L 0.47 --
# so the light ramps sit at ~100% of the ceiling at every rung and get x2.7 of chroma for free. On a
# dark page, once every rung must stay legible, that ceiling is FLAT (cool 0.145-0.176), so the dark
# ramps have to MANUFACTURE their ladder by holding the faint rungs below a ceiling they could have
# reached. Hence the two shapes: light descends into ever more chroma; dark arches -- rungs 1-3
# climbing, rung 4 dropping back to collect the chroma its hue only holds lower down. The dark FILLS
# invert the light ones the other way, sitting ABOVE the page as light panels rather than below it as
# tints, because a tint of a dark page is a hole. See dev/dark_palette.md for the whole derivation.

# THE COLOUR RAMPS -- one row per rung of every ramp, so a ladder reads DOWN a column: four rungs of
# rising intensity, over and under the reference, per channel and theme.
#   channel  "text" the ink, "bg" the fill, "bg_legend" the bg hues darkened to read as TEXT -- a
#            legend break-word cannot be drawn with a fill in every medium (an Excel run carries a
#            font colour only) and the pale fills are invisible on white. Light only. Regenerate
#            with dev/color_palette_tools.R::darken_for_legend().
#   theme    "light" / "dark".
#   dir      "over" / "under" -- which side of the reference the cell falls on.
#   rung     1-4, faint to strong.
#   hex      what ships.
#   oklch    "L C H", the coordinate the hex was tuned at: the chroma peaks above, the lightness
#            steps and the colour-blind safety are all read off this column, and nothing else does.

# === SECTION: the chrome -- everything that is NOT a colour-measure slot ===========================

# ONE resolver, per theme: tab_export_prep() builds `theme_cols` from it and tx_css_rules() emits it
# as CSS, so the two renderings cannot drift. The colour themes state their chrome here; a
# publication palette states its own two greys in PRINT_PALETTES, beside the ink ladder they sit next
# to.
#   text  : the table's own font colour (also what a reference cell gets -- it inherits, no class)
#   grey  : an uncoloured cell in a column that HAS a colour measure
#   grey2 : an uncoloured cell in a column with no colour measure -- and, by the same logic, the
#           SECONDARY tokens of a composite cell (color_secondary_hex()): both mean
#           "present, but nothing is being said about it"
#   on_fill : the ink a cell takes when it carries a FILL and no text colour of its own. NA means the
#           page's own ink already works -- true wherever the fills are a tint of the page, which is
#           every theme but dark. ⚠ THE DARK FILLS ARE LIGHT PANELS, not tints (see the ramps above),
#           so `text` (#f1efe0) measures APCA Lc 0 on them: unreadable, not merely faint. The value is
#           the page's own ground, so a filled cell reads as the page showing through -- Lc 66-87 on
#           the eight fills, against the light theme's 76 for black on its own.
#           ⚠ THREE RENDERERS MUST HONOUR IT, and each states it in its own idiom: the exports
#           (fmt_get_color_code), the footer legend, and the CONSOLE CELLS -- which paint the fill as
#           an ANSI background, so without it the cell keeps the terminal's own light foreground.
#   mark  : a publication palette's effect-size MARKS, which sit where the stars sit but are not an
#           aside: they REPLACE the colour, so they carry the deviation itself and must read as
#           strongly as the number. Pure black under every print palette (a superscript glyph at
#           grey2 is too faint to be seen at all); `grey2` elsewhere, where nothing writes a mark.
# DARK: pure #FFFFFF on #111111 is a harsh, glare-y contrast for body text, so the pairing is the
# softer #f1efe0 on #21252b -- Atom One Dark's deeper shade, which is also what the pkgdown site
# uses. The border stays the text colour, so it softens with it.
# ⚠ THIS GROUND IS A FALLBACK, not the ground the palette was tuned against being fixed. `tab_css()`
# writes `background:transparent` for the colour themes, so in an .Rmd, a .qmd or on the site the
# table follows the PAGE and this hex is never seen; it is the interactive Viewer's ground, and the
# reference the dark ramps are measured against. The ramps hold from L 0.20 to 0.30 (dev/dark_palette.md).
