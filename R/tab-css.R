# PURPOSE: the ONE CSS generator -- every stylesheet tabxplor emits, for every theme.
# ROLE: turns (palette, theme) into rules, for the two media that can carry a stylesheet: the html
#   engine and tab_md(). Cells and CSS read the SAME slot vocabulary (tx_slot_class), so they cannot
#   disagree, and tx_chrome_hex() (R/tab-palettes.R) is the one source of the chrome colours, which
#   the exporter prep's `theme_cols` reads too.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - THE CSS IS TABLE-INDEPENDENT: a pure function of (palette, theme). That is the whole point of
#     naming a class after a palette SLOT rather than a break value. It lets a document emit the
#     stylesheet ONCE and reuse it for every table, and it makes class collisions impossible --
#     `.p3` is the same shade in every table, whatever its color_breaks.
#   - "auto" is a RENDER intent, never a palette. Every palette lookup funnels through
#     tx_palette_theme(), or a key like "text_auto" gets built and errors on a length-0 vector.
#   - WARNING: NO BORDER SHORTHAND, anywhere. A shorthand resets border-*-color to `currentColor` --
#     the cell's own palette hex -- and every border rule here out-specifies the one border-color
#     rule. Always border-*-style plus border-*-width. Locked by test-render-html.R.
#   - WARNING: specificity is load-bearing in three places. `thead .tx-unit` is (0,2,1) like the
#     `thead .tx-r` / `.tx-l` pair, so it must be emitted AFTER them or the unit row re-centres
#     itself; `.tx-bb` and `.tx-bb2` are identical at (0,3,1), so their order decides; and the layer
#     order (the OS media query, then both page-toggle directions) is what lets a host's dark-mode
#     switch win over the base rules.
#   - THE HOST RESET is one rule for both media, `.tabxplor-tab th, .tabxplor-tab td
#     { border-width: 0 }`. A host page draws a border under every row (Bootstrap's
#     `.table > :not(caption) > * > *`, which pkgdown stamps on every table) and our border-colour
#     rule then paints it black. Every border we DRAW is a role class at (0,2,0) or better, so the
#     reset takes the host's and leaves ours. It is medium-agnostic on purpose: in the html engine
#     `.tabxplor-tab` IS the <table>, so a selector needing a `table` DESCENDANT never matches there.
#     The `.tabxplor-tab table ...` rules beside it are MD-ONLY by that same selector -- they redraw
#     our own chrome, which md carries no per-cell class for.
#   - THE COLOUR THEMES STATE `background-color: transparent` -- exactly what a cell has with no rule
#     at all -- so a host cannot override it and paint over the row hover. The background colour
#     CHANNEL (`.o3`, `.tx-pill`) is (0,2,0) and still wins. The TABLE follows the page the same way,
#     and for the same reason it is said rather than left unsaid; `tabxplor.background` (tx_table_bg)
#     is what paints a card instead, for a page that is not ours to follow.
#   - NO COLUMN WIDTH: the browser's auto table layout sizes each column to its content.
#     `.tx-rv` / `.tx-tot` / `.tx-num` are emitted UNSTYLED, as hooks for a reader's own CSS.
#   - WARNING: a browser does NOT grow a rowspanned cell to hold vertical text that overruns it. The
#     budget that prevents one is tab_vname_plan() (R/tab-export-prep.R), not a rule here -- a
#     max-height would truncate a variable name silently.
#   - WARNING: the tooltip selector cannot be scoped -- bootstrap moves the element to <body>.
#   - PRINT RULES: browsers drop background-color unless the reader enables "Background graphics", so
#     a publication palette speaks with ink and face. `print_marks` is REFUSED there: its signal is
#     cell text, and a print rule can restyle a page but not add characters to it.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the colour system); R/tab-palettes.R (what a slot
#      IS); R/tab-export-prep.R (the three header rows).

# === SECTION: the public generator =================================================================

# WARNING: in the "Two workflows" section below, the FOUR-backtick fence is load-bearing, and so is
# carrying no `{r}` info string -- roxygen2 (>= 7.1) EVALUATES a ```{r} chunk in roxygen markdown and
# splices its output into the page, so a three-backtick chunk meant to be SHOWN, not run, needs the
# longer fence. Never mix raw Rd (`\preformatted{}`) with a code fence for the same reason.

#' The stylesheet an html table needs
#'
#' The CSS that colours tabxplor tables. It is a **constant** -- a pure function of the colour palette,
#' the channel type and the theme -- so it does not take a table: one stylesheet styles every table in a
#' document, whatever their `color_breaks`.
#'
#' Cells carry classes named after the palette **slot** (`.p1`-`.p4` over-represented text, `.m1`-`.m4`
#' under-represented text, `.o1`-`.o4` / `.u1`-`.u4` for the background channel), so [tab_html()] and
#' [tab_md()] share one vocabulary.
#'
#' @section Two workflows:
#' **Self-contained (the default).** `tab_html(css = TRUE)` and `tab_md(css = TRUE)` inline the
#' stylesheet with the table, so a single file works anywhere (the RStudio/Positron Viewer, jamovi, a
#' standalone `.html`). Nothing to do.
#'
#' **Once per document.** In an `.Rmd`/`.qmd` with many tables, emit it once and let every table reuse
#' it:
#'
#' ````
#' ```{r, results = "asis"}
#' options(tabxplor.tab_kable_css = FALSE)
#' tab_css(theme = "auto")
#' ```
#' ````
#'
#' Every later [tab_html()] then emits classes only. Two things to know: with `css = FALSE` and **no**
#' `tab_css()` call the tables render uncoloured; and one stylesheet means one `theme` for the whole
#' document.
#'
#' @section Restyling a table:
#' Nothing is written inline on a cell, so **any** of the look can be overridden by adding your own
#' rules after the stylesheet -- no `!important` needed. The cell colour classes are also emitted
#' scoped (`.tabxplor-tab .p1`) so they survive host pages that style table cells themselves, such as
#' Bootstrap-based sites including pkgdown. Column widths in particular are left to the browser, which
#' sizes each column to its content; to pin one, style its role:
#' \preformatted{
#' .tabxplor-tab .tx-rv  { min-width: 10em; }   /* the row-variable levels column */
#' .tabxplor-tab .tx-tot { min-width: 5.5em; }  /* total columns                  */
#' .tabxplor-tab .tx-num { min-width: 4em; }    /* every number column            */
#' }
#' The roles a cell can carry: `.tx-l`/`.tx-r` (alignment), `.tx-num` (numbers), `.tx-rv` (the
#' row-variable levels column), `.tx-tot` (total columns), `.tx-bl`/`.tx-br` (side borders),
#' `.tx-b` (bold), `.tx-lbl`/`.tx-vname` (a variable name spanning its block), `.tx-pill` (a
#' background-coloured value), `.tx-span` (the variable-name header row), `.tx-foot` (the footnote).
#' Rows carry `.tx-bt`/`.tx-bb`/`.tx-bb2` (top / bottom / thick-bottom rules).
#'
#' @param theme `"light"`, `"dark"`, a black-and-white publication palette (`"print_ready"`,
#'   `"print_marks"`, `"print_emphasis"`, `"print_minimalistic"`; `"bw"` is a synonym of the last --
#'   see the section below), or -- opt-in -- `"auto"` to follow the reader's colour scheme (their
#'   operating system, and any dark-mode toggle of the host page: Quarto, Bootstrap 5.3, Tailwind).
#'   Defaults to `getOption("tabxplor.theme")`, i.e. `"light"`: a dark table is always a deliberate
#'   choice. `"auto"` emits every rule four times (a light base, the OS media query, then both toggle
#'   directions), which is also what lets [tab_html()]'s own Viewer page force the editor's theme.
#' @param print_rules Also emit a black-and-white publication palette inside an `@media print`
#'   block, so a coloured page prints (or saves to PDF) publication-ready with no further action.
#'   Defaults to `getOption("tabxplor.print_rules")`. Set to `FALSE` if your printer is a colour one
#'   and the colours are the point, or name a palette (`"print_emphasis"`) to print in that one.
#'   `"print_marks"` cannot be used here: its marks are cell text, and a print rule can restyle a
#'   page but not add characters to it. It adds roughly 1.5 KB to a `light`/`dark` stylesheet and
#'   6 KB to an `"auto"` one.
#' @param ... Retired arguments, accepted and ignored with a deprecation message since 2.0.0
#'   (`color_type`): the text channel always uses the text palette, and the colour CHANNEL is chosen
#'   by `color = c(text, background)` (see [tab()]).
#'   Anything else is an error naming the argument you meant, as it already was in [tab()].
#' @param format Which output the stylesheet is for, in [tab_export()]'s own vocabulary.
#'   `"html"` (the default) is the full stylesheet [tab_html()] needs: the colour classes **and**
#'   the table's own look (font, background, border colours, the greys). `"md"` emits the colour
#'   classes only, which is what [tab_md()] wants --- bare selectors you can map in your own editor's
#'   or publisher's CSS.
#' @param style_tag Wrap the CSS in a `<style>` tag (default `TRUE`).
