# PURPOSE: THE SHAPE OF A NUMERIC VARIABLE -- how a number enters a table or a model when it is not
#   wanted as one raw slope or one raw mean.
# ROLE: one vocabulary for both producers. `tab(shape =)` and `tab_reg(shape =)` are the same
#   argument reading the same table: cut a number into quantile groups or mean/SD bands (it becomes
#   an ordinary factor, and every subsystem downstream keeps reading a factor), or transform it and
#   keep it a number. What a fit adds on top -- the quadratic TERM -- stays in R/reg-assumptions.R,
#   beside the check whose cure it is.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - VAR_SHAPES is the vocabulary. A shape's `producers` is what makes a refusal DERIVED: `tab()`
#     fits no model, so it cannot take `"quadratic"`, and the message says so from the row rather
#     than from a hand-written clause.
#   - A CUT IS APPLIED ONCE, on the whole population, before any split. Both producers do it at
#     their argument boundary, so every sub-table / sub-model is cut at the SAME places; a per-group
#     quantile would silently compare different things.
#   - THE BREAKS RIDE OUT WITH THE FACTOR (`tabxplor_breaks` / `tabxplor_labels`) and are frozen
#     back into the spec. A refit or a replay re-cuts at those exact places -- a weighted quantile
#     of a different frame would not land there.
#   - `ordered` DIFFERS BY PRODUCER, and it is not taste: `tab()` wants an ordered index (bands have
#     a real order), a fit wants treatment contrasts (an ordered factor gets polynomial ones). It is
#     an argument, defaulting to the fit's answer.
#   - THE LABEL IS THE ONLY THING A READER GETS, and it says NOTHING THE BOUNDS ALREADY SAY. It
#     carries the real cut points, and for a BAND the landmark it sits at ("[30,48) ; < mean"),
#     which no interval states; a quantile group's rank is readable off its own interval, so it
#     carries no tag. On a WHOLE-NUMBERED column it names the VALUES instead of the interval holding
#     them ("0", "1 or 2", "3 to 6"): the breaks are already snapped to integers, so the two say the
#     same thing and one of them is readable. The variable's own name goes on the FIRST level only
#     when `tab(shape_name = TRUE)` asks -- the one case that earns it is a table whose leading text
#     columns are stripped.
#   - A QUANTILE CUT GIVES k GROUPS WHENEVER THE VALUES ALLOW IT. Ties make two quantiles land on
#     one value, and deduplicating the breaks used to lose a group silently -- `quartiles` giving 3
#     where `quintiles` gave 4, on one column. shape_fill_breaks() fills back up at the distinct
#     values the quantiles missed; a genuine shortfall is stated, once.
#   - `cut()` is always called `right = FALSE, include.lowest = TRUE`, so every label is the
#     paren-free `[a,b)` form: cleannames_condition() (R/utils.R) strips any balanced ` (...)` group.
#   - THE DECLARATION ORDER IS THE OFFER ORDER, numeric first then the cuts coarse-to-fine, and
#     `values_to_levels` last because it is the one that explodes the level count. Both jamovi
#     pickers are emitted from it verbatim (dev/generate_jamovi_js.R), so reordering here reorders
#     them -- and the FIRST entry of a list is what that picker treats as "nothing stored".
#   - A TRANSFORM RENAMES ITS COLUMN, and shape_rename_transformed() returns that map (`renames`)
#     BECAUSE a fingerprint keyed on a column name would otherwise lose the source it came from --
#     which is exactly what the jamovi cache keys do (R/jmvtab-cache.R, via ctx$shape_renames).
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture; R/reg-assumptions.R (the quadratic term and the checks
#   whose cure `shape` is).

# === SECTION: the exported primitive ===============================================================

#' Cut or transform a numeric variable
#'
#' @description
#' Turn a number into the form you want to read it in: cut it into quantile groups or into bands at
#' the mean and one standard deviation either side (it becomes an ordinary factor), or transform it
#' and keep it a number. This is the same operation `tab(shape =)` and [tab_reg()]`(shape =)`
#' perform, exposed on its own vector, so a column you cut by hand is identical to one they cut.
#'
#' @param x A numeric vector.
#' @param shape A single string, or a number of groups --- see \emph{The shapes} below.
#' @param w Optional weights, the same length as `x`. Quantile breaks and the mean/SD landmarks are
#'   then weighted --- equal shares of the *population*, not of the sample.
#' @param name The variable's name, written onto the **first level only** (`"age: [18,35) low"`), so
#'   a table that names the variable nowhere else still says what the levels are levels *of*. `NULL`
#'   (the default here) writes nothing. It applies to the two CUTS, whose levels are intervals and
#'   band words; `"values_to_levels"` keeps the raw values, which name themselves.
#' @param ordered Whether the resulting factor is `ordered`. Bands and quantile groups do have a
#'   real order; a model fit does not want one (an ordered factor takes polynomial contrasts instead
#'   of contrasts against a reference), which is why [tab_reg()] cuts unordered.
#'
#' @return For a cut: a factor whose levels carry the real cut points and, in words, where each group
#'   sits. For `"log"` / `"sqrt"`: a numeric vector.
#'
#' @section The mean of a transform is not the transform of the mean:
#' `"log"` and `"sqrt"` replace the values, so a crosstab column then shows the mean *of the
#' logarithm* --- a different quantity from the logarithm of the mean, and smaller. [tab()] renames
#' the column for that reason (`age` becomes `log_age`), so no header promises the wrong quantity;
#' do the same if you shape a column by hand.
#'
#' @eval shape_values_rd()

#' @seealso [tab()] and [tab_reg()], whose `shape` argument is this function applied once to the
#'   whole population, before any sub-table or sub-model is split off.
