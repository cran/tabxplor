# PURPOSE: the colour legend -- the SENTENCE that says what a table's colours mean.
# ROLE: one of the three parts of what a table says about itself. The MEASURE's facts are declared in
#   R/fmt_class.R (MEASURES) and read through measure_facts(); this file renders them into words; the
#   REGION those words are printed in -- the order, the media, the notes and subordinate tables --
#   is R/tab-footer.R.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Driven by the SAME per-channel plan (fmt_color_plan) and slot->palette path the CELLS use, so a
#     legend and the cells it describes can never disagree.
#   - Composed at RENDER, never at build: the theme changes the ladder's length and the note's words,
#     the medium chooses terse vs prose, and a post-build select()/set_display() changes what there is
#     to say. See dev/legend_and_side_tables.md section 3.
#   - Every user-visible word is a gettext() call inside a function, so it resolves at render (a
#     top-level gettext() would freeze the build locale) while potools still extracts the literal.
#   - THE WORDS ARE A FOUR-LAYER FOLD, all in measure_facts(): the MEASURES row, its `guar` override
#     (the significance policy), its `by_scale` one (the ladder), and LAST the table's own
#     (set_legend_words(), meta$legend_words). ⚠ Naming only -- a table attribute must never change a
#     number, so MEASURE_WORD_FIELDS admits no engine fact and no ladder glyph, and a re-stated word
#     is DATA (a string, never a closure: a closure in `meta` captures a namespace and breaks
#     saveRDS()). ⚠ A BASELINE word (`ref`, and the two shapes it feeds) is refused on a measure whose
#     reference is a row of the table rather than a concept -- there the legend names what the table
#     shows, so a word could only be stored and ignored.
#   - The gettext SCOPE is opened ONCE per footer (tab_footer_streams()); with_legend_lang() is
#     re-entrant, so the nested calls here are free and every builder answers in the same language.
#   - ⚠ IN HTML EVERY PLAIN TOKEN IS ESCAPED, `esc` or not (legend_render_line()): a footer line
#     carries a person's note, a variable name, a level name -- data, all of it -- and a results pane
#     that runs inline scripts (jamovi 28.x) would otherwise run a shared file's author's JavaScript.
#     Markup written in a note is therefore SHOWN, never run. `esc` keeps only its md meaning, where
#     it escapes the pandoc-active `*` and `$` of a token that is data.
# See: dev/legend_and_side_tables.md; CLAUDE.md section "The colour system".

# Pipeline (one spec -> two assemblers -> per-medium renderer):
#   legend_specs(x)                         per col_var group: measures / breaks / ref / method /
#                                           policy / shade names / reg effect word.
#   legend_tokens_terse / _prose            a TOKEN stream (plain-text | coloured-break tokens);
#                                           `terse` = compact (console), `prose` = full sentences
#                                           (exports), translated via gettext (domain "R-tabxplor").
#   legend_render_line(tokens, medium)      console ansi (cli) / html text_spec / md pandoc span /
#                                           excel fmt_txt runs / plain.
# The break-word colours come from the engine's per-side slots (over 1:4, under 5:8) indexed into the
# 8-hex palette -- the exact path fmt_channel_codes() / tx_slot_class() use for the cells.
#
# THE PROSE GRAMMAR, one shape for every case (see legend_tokens_prose):
#   [<col names> -- ]<HEAD><LADDER> <NOTE>
#     HEAD    the measure NAMED IN WORDS ("Percentage points (risk) difference:"), which is what a
#             reader needs first. Dropped where the subject already IS the measure (a regression's
#             effect word) or where the measure writes its own lead (the gap measures). Under
#             `guaranteed_effect` it carries the guarantee and names the interval ONCE, both channels.
#     LADDER  per side "<subject> >= <ref> <breaks> <unit>", the two sides joined by ";" -- ONE
#             sentence. Under `guaranteed_effect` they merge into one list after "from <ref>".
#     NOTE    what an UNCOLOURED (or, on a publication palette, UNMARKED) cell means. Only that:
#             "coloured => significant" is a tautology the cells already show.
# THE MEASURE IS NAMED IN TWO REGISTERS, both facts on the MEASURES row: `word` (short) for the
# console and a plot guide, `word_long` (per SCALE, via by_scale) for the export footers -- a
# difference of proportions, of means and of log odds are three quantities, not one word.

# is THIS column the baseline of its own gap measure? A measure whose baseline is another column leaves
# `obs` empty on the column that IS that baseline (the reference group, or a model with no observed
# counterpart), so not one cell can be coloured. Say what the column is instead of printing an
# unreachable ladder. Tested on the STORED `obs` being empty, not the plan's gate (grey_non_signif also
# gates nothing on a comparable column, which must still show its ladder).
