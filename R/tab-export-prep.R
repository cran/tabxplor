# PURPOSE: the ONE preparation step every exporter runs, and the ephemeral RENDER MODEL it produces.
# ROLE: an exporter is `prep <- tab_export_prep(...)` then `render_<backend>(prep)`. Everything the
#   four backends would otherwise each derive -- the canonical col_vars, the per-cell colour and
#   face, the roles, the references, the header bands, the variable-name blocks -- is computed HERE,
#   once, so a fix lands in one place and two media cannot disagree. What stays local to a backend is
#   only what its own medium decides: its markup, its escaping, how it hides an NA.
#
# THE HEADER BLOCK IS THREE ROWS, and this file decides it for every backend:
#   1. the variable-NAME span -- which col_var this run of columns belongs to
#   2. the LEVEL names        -- what the table HAS
#   3. the UNIT row           -- what each column HOLDS ("<row%>", "<row% (n)>", "<OR (row%)>"),
#                                built by fmt_display_label() from the column's own display
#                                template, in the console type tag's own angle brackets
#   The unit row exists because a composite cell showed an aside in every row and named it nowhere.
#   Each backend then does what its medium allows with those three -- html gives them <tr>s, md
#   collapses them into body rows under the delimiter, Excel writes the data block one row lower --
#   and none of them re-decides WHICH row says what.
#
# A NAME IS PRINTED ONCE, ON BOTH AXES. Down the rows tab_label_runs() blanks a repeated row_var;
#   along the header a col_var opening a second labelled run is blanked the same way; and where every
#   column already prints its own col_var (a `predictors` comparison, whose columns ARE the models)
#   the whole span row goes.
#
# ONE UNIT PER BLOCK. tab_col_block_ids() is THE definition of a column block -- a col_var run within
#   one sub-population, a Total column its own, every col_var-less helper joined to whatever it was
#   carved from. Two consumers read it: the unit line (so a Total says "<row%>" and the count beside
#   it "<n>") and tab_xl()'s vertical rules (so no line falls between a Total and its own count).
#   Anything needing to know where a block starts asks this function; it is not re-derived.
#
# A TAB_VAR COLUMN IS DROPPED ONLY WHERE THE LEVEL COLUMN IS A COMPLETE ROW INDEX -- one row_var,
#   where a sub-table is one contiguous run of levels and its Total row names it ("Total 2000"). A
#   COMPACTED table nests variable x sub-table, so the column stays whatever the backend asked for.
#
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - The render model is an EPHEMERAL S3-tagged list, never table attributes: dplyr's rename/select
#     desync bare attributes. Built once, consumed by one backend, discarded.
#   - WHICH ROW A COLUMN SAYS ITS NAME IN: the level header names what the table HAS, the unit line
#     what it HOLDS. A column the RENDER carved out of another -- a split-off aside, the base count
#     taken out of a Total cell -- has no level to name and is named by its unit alone; a helper the
#     table already had (a regression's `n`) keeps both. Not under a transpose, which turns the level
#     header into the row label and carries no unit line to say it instead.
#   - A WHOLE-TABLE HELPER IS NOT A VARIABLE: a base-count or col% column (`role`) takes no name on
#     the span row. The `sd` twin and Excel's `aside` columns are NOT helpers in that sense -- they
#     are the second half of their col_var's block and keep its span.
#   - EXPORT DOES NOT RENAME, and a label column is identified by its POSITION. Only the VALUES are
#     wrapped here (tx_wrap_labels); a header's own wrapping is a LABEL in this model, decided once
#     at the tail of tab_col_var_header(). So `names(tab)` is raw from prep to backend, nothing keyed
#     by a column name can go stale, and `label_cols` / `label_runs` / `vname_plans` are PARALLEL
#     vectors a consumer walks by index -- a name is what it prints, never what it looks up.
#     tx_unwrap_text() is no longer a defence sprinkled over every comparison: it survives only where
#     a wrap that ALREADY happened must be undone -- one the USER applied before exporting (the
#     header's first line, the `bars` key, the legend's own suffix strip), or this file's own row-label
#     wrap where a name column is then re-wrapped to its block's width.
#   - HOW WIDE A COL_VAR NAME MAY BE is what its own columns leave it (tab_span_labels): past that it
#     wraps at the seams a compound name is built from, and past what wrapping can do it is shown
#     from the prefix it shares with the block before it ("MUS_CONCERT_CLASSIQUE", then "_ROCK"), and
#     in the last resort held to `wrap_cols`, the width every other header obeys -- one name is not
#     entitled to widen the table on its own.
#     Never while there is room for the whole name -- which is what makes the elision readable, since
#     a reader meets the full name first and again whenever the prefix changes. ⚠ An elided name does
#     not carry where the previous one was cut: html hands the full one over in a `title=`, and no
#     other medium can.
#   - WARNING: block boundaries are read off the label columns' VALUES, never off the dplyr grouping.
#     group_indices() answers 1 for every row of a table that has lost its grouped_df class, and the
#     separators then vanish with no error.
#   - WHICH NAMES ROTATE is one decision too (tab_vname_plan), and one rule: a rotation must SAVE
#     width. A turned line costs the column about one character, so a name turns when it needs fewer
#     turned lines than the width it would otherwise force -- weighed against the names that CANNOT
#     turn (a one-row block), which set the column's floor. Turned, a name wraps SOFT and unindented
#     (tx_vname_wrap): an overrun there only makes the rows a hair taller, where a horizontal one
#     would widen the table. ⚠ How many turned characters a block holds is MEASURED per medium and
#     the two differ (tx_vert_capacity), so the plan is computed against the backend being exported.

# Excel lay out in their own units, but `wrap_cols` is already a character rule and this is its
# sibling. Then, per span, the FIRST of these that fits:
#   1. the full name, wrapped to the budget where it must be;
#   2. the prefix-elided name (tx_elide_prefix), wrapped the same way;
#   3. whichever is shorter, held to `wrap_cols` -- the width every other header obeys -- and only
#      overflowing past that where even it cannot be reached at a seam.
# DESIGN: nothing is shortened while there is room for it, which is what makes the elision readable:
#   a reader meets the full name first, and meets it again whenever the prefix changes.
# ⚠ A SPAN NAME IS NEVER HARD-BROKEN. tx_wrap_name(hard = TRUE) would honour any cap, but a header
#   reading "CONCER / T_ROCK" is worse than one that overflows, and worse than the elision it was
#   preferred over. A candidate whose widest segment exceeds the budget therefore does not "fit" at
#   all -- which is what sends a narrow block to the elision, and a first block to its full name.
# A medium that cannot hold a line break (markdown, `wrap = NULL`) has only steps 2 and 3, which is
# why the elision is the one compaction a pipe cell can actually use.
