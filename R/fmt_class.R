# PURPOSE: tabxplor_fmt, the rich-cell vctrs record -- plus the colour engine and legend that read it.
# ROLE: Foundation of the package. Every numeric column of a table is an fmt vector; the colour engine
#   here is the one artifact every backend (console / HTML / Excel / Markdown / plot) consumes.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Fields are per-cell (vctrs::field); attributes are per-column (attr). Never confuse the two.
#   - WHAT A COLUMN ESTIMATES is STORED, not derived: `scale` is one key into EST_SCALES (which field
#     holds the estimate, its null, geometry, colour ladder, SD source); `pct_type` is which axis its
#     reference lies on; `ci_method` says which engine built the bounds. Read them through
#     fmt_scale_row() / fmt_var_kind() / get_pct_type(); never re-derive a scale from a display, a
#     family, or from whether `var` is non-NA.
#   - The record is DENSE: every column carries all fields, an inapplicable one stored as NA.
#   - A REFERENCE IS READ PER BLOCK, NEVER GLOBALLY: under `comp = "all"` the total table holds one
#     reference row per row_var, so a cell reads the FIRST one at or after it (fmt_broadcast_next),
#     the total table closing each variable's run of sub-tables. Broadcasting one scalar to the whole
#     column was a length blow-up the moment two row_vars were stacked.
#   - pct is stored 0-1 (x100 only in format()); `diff` is always a DIFFERENCE (the ratio is `ratio`).
#   - `{est}` / `{base}` are SCALE-RELATIVE tokens: they name a role, and each column answers with the
#     token it has always rendered (EST_SCALES' est_display / base_display, resolved once by
#     fmt_resolve_scale_tokens()). That is why they need no arm of their own anywhere.
#   - ONE multiplicative rendering, outside `special_formatting` so composites keep it: a value below
#     its neutral prints as its inverse, with the MEASURE's own glyphs (MEASURES$break_over/under, the
#     pair the legend ladder and the forest axis print). options(tabxplor.ratio_print = "raw") opts out.
#   - THE BASELINE PRINTS THE BARE NEUTRAL -- "1" on a multiplicative column, "0" / "0%" on an
#     additive one -- and only a cell that IS the baseline does: one that merely ROUNDS to the neutral
#     keeps its glyph and its sign ("x1.00", "+0%"), so the reader can tell the two apart. Both rules
#     sit outside `special_formatting`, or the composite recursion would disagree with the bare token.
#   - FORMAT() NEVER PASTES A STRING IT DID NOT RENDER (fmt_rendered()): a void field is BLANK, never
#     the literal "NA", and takes no significance star.
#   - fmt_display_label() IS THE ONE SOURCE OF A COLUMN'S NAME, as format() is of its cells': it walks
#     the column's own template and substitutes each token's declared short `label`
#     (DISPLAY_TOKENS, R/tab-display.R), so the console type tag, the exports' unit header row and an
#     Excel aside column's header cannot name a layout three different ways. It keeps the template's
#     STRUCTURE, not its wording -- of every literal only the brackets survive -- and a column is
#     named by its DATA rows (`row_kind`), never by a p-value or base-count row sharing its column,
#     nor by a template that renders nothing wherever it sits.
#   - Adding a FIELD touches ~9 sites here (follow the /vctrs-field skill); adding an ATTRIBUTE is a
#     new_fmt() formal + one `fmt_attr_rules` row (a build-time stopifnot refuses a missing row).
#   - THE ACCESSORS ARE DOCUMENTED ON THE FIELD/ATTRIBUTE LINE, not in one wall: `?fmt` is the record,
#     `?fmt_fields` the 15 per-cell accessors, `?fmt_attributes` the 24 per-column ones. A new
#     accessor takes `@describeIn fmt_fields` or `@describeIn fmt_attributes` -- and NOT its own
#     `@return`, which each page states once for every getter and setter it holds.
#   - Display glyph constants (mult_sign, div_sign, unbrk, sigma_sign, fig_space) live in utils.R.
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture (type system + colour system); /vctrs-field + /color-mode skills.

# EXPORTED FUNCTIONS TO WORK WITH CLASS FMT ##############################################


#' Create an `fmt` vector, the tabxplor cell
#' @description \code{fmt} vectors, of class \code{tabxplor_fmt}, powers \pkg{tabxplor}
#' and \code{\link{tab}} tibbles.
#' As a \code{\link[vctrs:new_rcrd]{record}}, they stores all data necessary to
#' calculate percentages, Chi2 metadata or confidence intervals, but also to format and
#' color the table to help the user read it. You can access this data with
#' \code{\link[vctrs:field]{vctrs::field}}, or change it with
#' \code{\link[vctrs:field]{vctrs:field<-}}. Its per-cell \strong{fields} are listed below.
#' The other arguments are \strong{attributes}, attached not to each value but to
#' the whole vector, like \code{scale}, \code{col_var}, \code{totcol} or \code{color}. You can get
#' them with \code{\link[base:attr]{attr}} and modify them with
#' \code{\link[base:attr]{attr<-}}. Special functions listed below are made to
#' facilitate programming with with \pkg{tabxplor} formatted numbers.
#' \code{taxplfmt} vectors can use all standard operations, like +, -, sum(), or c(),
#' using \pkg{vctrs}.
#'
#' @param n The underlying count, as an integer vector of length \code{n()}. It is used
#' to calculate confidence intervals.
#' @param scale What the column estimates, as a single string (an attribute, not a field): one key
#' into the declared library of estimate scales. It says which field holds the estimate, what its
#' null value is, whether the scale is additive or multiplicative, and which colour ladder it reads.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{"level_n"}: counts
#'   \item \code{"level_pct"}: percentages (\code{pct_type} says of what)
#'   \item \code{"level_mean"}: means (from numeric variables)
#'   \item \code{"points"}: a difference between two percentages, in percentage points
#'   \item \code{"mean_diff"}: a difference between two means, in the outcome's own units
#'   \item \code{"raw_diff"}: a regression coefficient / marginal effect in the outcome's units
#'   \item \code{"pct_ratio"}, \code{"mean_ratio"}: the ratio of two percentages / two means
#'   \item \code{"odds_ratio"}: a multiplicative effect (odds ratio, risk ratio, rate ratio)
#'   \item \code{"log_coef"}: a link-scale coefficient (a log-odds, a log-rate)
#'   \item \code{"mixed"}: what binding columns of unlike scales collapses to
#' }
#' @param pct_type For a percentage column, what the percentage is a percentage OF, and hence which
#' axis its reference lies on (as a single string): \code{"row"}, \code{"col"}, \code{"all"}
#' (frequencies by subtable / group, i.e. by \code{tab_vars}), \code{"all_tabs"} (frequencies for
#' the whole table), or \code{"none"} (counts, means, coefficients).
#' @param digits The number of digits, as an integer, or an integer vector the length
#' of \code{n}.
#' @param display The display type : the name of the field you want to show when printing
#' the vector, as a single string or a character vector the length of \code{n}. Every accepted
#'  value is listed in \emph{Every display token} below; a named layout or a \code{\{\}} template
#'  combining several (e.g. \code{"\{pct\} (n=\{n\})"}) is also accepted --- see
#'  \link{tabxplor-display}.
#' @param wn The underlying weighted counts, as a double vector the length of
#' \code{n}. It is used in certain operations on \code{\link{fmt}}, like means.
#' @param pct The percentages, as a double vector the length of \code{n}.
#'  Calculate with \code{\link{tab_pct}}.
#' @param mean The means, as a double vector the length of \code{n}.
#' @param diff The differences (from totals or first cells),
#' as a double vector the length of \code{n}. Used to set colors for means and
#' row or col percentages. Built by \code{\link{tab}}.
#' @param ratio The ratio to the reference (relative risk for percentages, mean ratio for
#' means), as a double vector the length of \code{n}.
#' @param ctr The contributions of cells to (sub)tables variances,
#' as a double vector the length of \code{n}. Used to print colors when
#' \code{color = "contrib"}. The mean contribution of each (sub)table is written on
#' total rows (then, colors don't print well without total rows).
#' Built by \code{\link{tab}}. The cell's adjusted standardized residual is not a
#' field of its own: it is recovered from \code{pvalue} and this field's sign, and readable with
#' \code{display = "resid"} (see \code{\link{tab}}).
#' @param var The cells variances, as a double vector the length of \code{n}.
#' Used with \code{scale = "level_mean"} to calculate confidence intervals.
#' @param ci The confidence interval half-width (margin of error), as a double vector the
#' length of \code{n}. Kept for backward compatibility: it is stored as the symmetric
#' bounds \code{ci_inf}/\code{ci_sup} and read back by \code{get_ci()}.
#' @param ci_inf,ci_sup The lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, as double
#' vectors the length of \code{n}. Built by \code{\link{tab}}.
#' @param pvalue The per-cell significance p-value, as a double vector the length of
#' \code{n}.
#' @param or The odds ratio (for a 3+ level variable, the OR of each level versus the reference),
#'   as a double vector the length of \code{n}.
#' @param tot_n The cell's own (unweighted) percentage base, as a double vector the length
#' of \code{n}.
#' @param n_eff The effective sample size used for this cell's confidence interval,
#' \code{p(1-p) / Var_design(p)} (a mean: \code{s^2 / Var_design(mean)}): from
#' \code{survey::svyrecvar} under a \code{survey::svydesign}, from the closed-form flat-design
#' variance when the weighted basis is asked for (\code{tab(design_effect = TRUE)}), else \code{NA}
#' (the CI falls back to the raw unweighted base). It records \emph{the base that was used}: a finite
#' value where the design or weights corrected it, \code{NA} where nothing did, and the \strong{raw
#' count} where a correction was asked for but this cell could not carry one. Populated for
#' descriptive cells (a crosstab/mean cell, a \code{tab_reg} \code{Obs_*} column whose interval came
#' from a closed form); a coefficient column, and any column whose interval came from a fit instead,
#' carry none. A double vector the length of \code{n}. Non-displayed.
#' @param obs The value this cell's estimate is COMPARED TO by the \code{tab_reg} colour measures
#' \code{"adjustment"} / \code{"between_groups"}, on the cell's own scale: the observed (crude)
#' effect beside a model effect, or -- under \code{tab_vars} with \code{color = "between_groups"} --
#' the reference group's estimate. \code{NA} on cross-tables and wherever there is no counterpart
#' (leaving those cells uncoloured). A double vector the length of \code{n}; displayable as
#' \code{display = "\{obs\}"}.
#' @param gap_se The standard error of the GAP between this cell's estimate and \code{obs}, on the
#' estimate's own test scale. Written by \code{tab_reg} where the two estimates are independent
#' (\code{tab_vars} groups), so \code{color = "between_groups"} can honour \code{color_signif};
#' \code{NA} elsewhere. A double vector the length of \code{n}. Non-displayed.
#' @param row_kind What kind of row the cell sits in --- one of \code{"data"} (an ordinary body row),
#' \code{"total"}, and the synthetic display rows \code{"n"}, \code{"pct"}, \code{"pvalue"},
#' \code{"gof"}, \code{"blank"}. A character vector the length of \code{n}. It supersedes the logical
#' \code{in_totrow} field, kept as a soft-deprecated argument and read-only \code{$in_totrow}.
#' @param in_totrow `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` Use \code{row_kind = "total"}.
#' @param in_tottab \code{TRUE} when the cell is part of a total table
#' @param in_refrow \code{TRUE} when the cell is part of a reference row
#' (cf. \code{ref})
#' @param comp_all  \code{FALSE} when the comparison level is the subtable/group,
#' \code{TRUE} when it is the whole table
#' @param ref The type of difference of the vector. Cf. \code{\link{tab}}.
#' @param col_var The name of the \code{col_var} used to calculate the vector
#' @param col_group The sub-population this column's block belongs to: a level of a
#'   \code{spread_vars} variable (\code{\link{tab_spread}}), or a \code{\link{tab_reg}}
#'   \code{tab_vars} group. \code{""} (the default) when the table was never spread. Together with
#'   \code{col_var} it identifies a column BLOCK: two blocks may show the same variable for two
#'   sub-populations, and exports head them on two lines.
#' @param totcol \code{TRUE} when the vector is a total column
#' @param refcol \code{TRUE} when the vector is a reference column
#' @param x The object to test, to get a field in, or to modify.
#' @param ... In \code{fmt()}, it exists only for the arguments retired in tabxplor 2.0.0:
#'   \code{type} is translated into \code{scale} + \code{pct_type} (see
#'   \code{\link{tabxplor-type}}), \code{ci_type} gets an error naming its replacement. In the
#'   accessor methods below, to add arguments in the future.
#' @param color The colour measure, as a single string --- how a cell's value is compared to colour
#' it (significance is handled separately by \code{color_signif}):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{"no"}: no colors are printed.
#'   \item \code{"diff"} (\code{"difference"}): the cell's difference from the reference (a total, or
#'   the first cell when \code{ref = "first"}) --- percentage points for factors, a standardized
#'   difference for means.
#'   \item \code{"ratio"}: the ratio to the reference (relative risk for percentages, mean ratio).
#'   \item \code{"or"} (\code{"odds_ratio"}): the odds ratio, for row/col percentages.
#'   \item \code{"contrib"}: the cell's contribution to the table's variance. Under
#'   \code{color_signif = "guaranteed_effect"} it switches to the absolute adjusted standardized
#'   residual --- see \code{\link{tab}}.
#'   \item \code{"adjustment"} / \code{"between_groups"}: the two \code{\link{tab_reg}} measures,
#'   which compare a cell to \emph{another column} rather than to a reference row. A hand-built
#'   column may carry them, provided it fills the \code{obs} field they score.
#' }
#' The value is \strong{validated and normalised}: every accepted spelling --- the discipline's
#' acronyms included (\code{"RD"}, \code{"RR"}, \code{"IRR"}, \code{"RoM"}, \code{"OR"} and their
#' lowercase twins) --- is stored as its canonical measure name, and an unknown one is an error.
#' The tabxplor 1.x combined strings \code{"diff_ci"} / \code{"after_ci"} still work but are
#' superseded by the \code{color} + \code{color_signif} pair; here they resolve to their
#' \emph{measure} half only, so pass the significance policy through \code{color_signif}.
#' @param color_signif How significance gates the color, as a single string
#' (\code{"ignore"} / \code{"grey_non_signif"} / \code{"guaranteed_effect"}). See \code{\link{tab}}.
#' @param model_family For regression tables (\code{\link{tab_reg}}): the column's model family
#' (\code{"binomial"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"poisson"}, \code{"multinomial"}, \code{"ordinal"}),
#' as a single string. Empty (\code{""}) on cross-tables. Lets a table mix several outcomes with
#' different families, each column keeping its own effect wording.
#' @param role For regression tables (\code{\link{tab_reg}}): the column's role, \code{"model"} for a
#' model-estimate column or \code{"emp"} for an empirical (crude) companion column. Empty (\code{""})
#' on cross-tables. Read by the colour legend to name each column's effect without matching its label.
#' @param conf_level The confidence level this column's interval and thresholds were computed at, as
#' a single number in (0, 1). \code{NA} (default) means "unknown" --- the colour engine then falls
#' back to \code{options("tabxplor.conf_level")}. Stored per COLUMN, because colours are resolved per
#' column at print time and cannot see the table's \code{conf_level} argument.
#' @param degf The degrees of freedom this column's interval is referred to. On a cross-table that is
#' the survey design's \code{#PSU - #strata}, which matters below ~30 primary sampling units; on a
#' regression it is the fitted model's own residual df (for an \code{svyglm}, \code{degf + 1 - p}),
#' so a model column and its observed companion legitimately differ. \code{NA} (default) means
#' "refer to the normal quantile".
#' @param basis How this column's interval and significance were computed --- \code{"n"} (the raw
#' sample size), \code{"weights"} (the design effect of the weights), \code{"design"} (a full
#' \code{survey} design), or \code{"design_partial"} (a design was given but its variance could not
#' be computed). Default \code{"n"}. A per-COLUMN fact, so a table states honestly what its numbers
#' carry even after a pipeline drops the table's metadata; binding columns keeps the WEAKEST basis.
#' @param ci_method Which interval ENGINE built this column's bounds --- \code{"wilson"},
#' \code{"wald"}, \code{"beta"} (a cell proportion), \code{"newcombe"}, \code{"ac"} (a difference of
#' proportions), \code{"katz"} (a ratio of proportions), \code{"welch"}, \code{"student"},
#' \code{"ols"} (a difference of means), \code{"robust"}, \code{"quasipoisson"}, \code{"poisson"} (a ratio of
#' means), \code{"woolf"}, \code{"wald_log"}, \code{"profile"}; \code{""} (default) when the column
#' carries no interval. Read back by the colour legend, so it always names the method the bounds were
#' built with.

# === SECTION: The accessor surface -- two pages, one distinction ====================================
# A FIELD varies per cell, an ATTRIBUTE over a whole column. That is the type system's load-bearing
# line, so the accessors are documented on the two pages it draws, not on one wall of forty. Both
# take their parameter prose from fmt()'s own block (@inheritParams), so a field is described once.

#' Per-cell fields of a `fmt` vector
#'
#' @description
#' Read and write the values that vary from cell to cell: the displayed number, its decimals, its
#' p-value, and the kind of row each cell sits in. Every `fmt` vector carries all of them, an
#' inapplicable one stored as `NA` --- so these always answer, even on a column where the field
#' means nothing.
#'
#' Use them on a single `fmt` vector or, through `dplyr::across(where(is_fmt), ...)`, on a whole
#' table. To reach a field these do not name, use `x$<field>` or [vctrs::field()].
#'
#' @inheritParams fmt
#' @return A getter returns a vector the length of `x`; a setter the modified `fmt` vector. Given a
#'   data.frame, a getter answers once per `fmt` column.
#' @seealso [fmt()] for what every field means and how to build a cell; [fmt_attributes] for the
#'   per-column facts; `vignette("tabxplor-programming")`.
#' @name fmt_fields

#' Per-column attributes of a `fmt` vector
#'
#' @description
#' Read and write the facts that hold for a whole column: what it estimates, which percentage base
#' it rests on, which reference it is compared to, how it is coloured, and how its confidence
#' interval was built. They are stored on the vector, not on the table, so a column keeps them when
#' it is extracted, renamed or piped through `dplyr`.
#'
#' [fmt_attr()] reaches any of them by name --- these are the readable way to address one you know.
#' [tab_columns()] shows them all, for every column of a table at once.
#'
#' @inheritParams fmt
#' @return A getter returns the stored value --- its declared default where the attribute was never
#'   set (`""` for a name, `FALSE` for a flag, `NA` where there is none) --- and answers once per
#'   `fmt` column when given a data.frame. A setter returns the modified `fmt` vector.
#' @seealso [fmt_attr()] to address an attribute by name; [tab_columns()] for a whole table;

# === SECTION: display {} grammar ======================================
# The per-cell `display` field is EITHER a simple token ("pct"/"diff"/"n"/...) OR a glue-style
# COMPOSITE template ("{pct} (n={n})") that renders several fields in ONE value cell (text backends
# only -- get_num()/Excel fall back to the PRIMARY token). These three shared helpers are the single
# source of truth: one gated resolver, one parser, one write-time validator; every consumer that
# dispatches on the display token routes through display_primary().
#
# DESIGN: THE PRIMARY OF A COMPOSITE IS THE FIRST TOKEN OUTSIDE BRACKETS -- and, if every token is
# bracketed, the first one. A bracket is already this package's notation for a subordinate number, so
# the code reads what the reader reads, and a template may put the aside FIRST: "({base}) {est}"
# prints the level then the estimate while the ESTIMATE stays primary -- which is what puts a crude
# and a modelled effect side by side across a regression table. The primary is what carries the
# stars, what get_num() and Excel return, and what the colour gates dispatch on.

# The accepted {} field names and read-side aliases are the `user` / `alias` columns of DISPLAY_TOKENS
# (R/tab-display.R, as DISPLAY_USER_FIELDS / DISPLAY_ALIASES). Facts worth stating here beside
# get_num()/set_num():
#   - `resid` is a DERIVED field (fmt_resid(): the adjusted standardized residual from p-value + the
#     contribution's sign), read-only: get_num() has an arm, set_num() does not (`settable = FALSE`).
#   - `obs` is a real stored FIELD (the value a reg cell is compared to), so it round-trips.
#   - `coef` is DERIVED where the column is multiplicative -- log(estimate) IS the coefficient the
#     model fitted -- and settable all the same: the write mirrors the read through exp().
#   - the canonical internal token is `ratio` (`rr` is a READ-SIDE alias only).
# R/tab-display.R loads AFTER this file; fine, every read below is at RUN time.

# === SECTION: the ESTIMATE's scale =================================================================
#
# `MEASURES` above says what a COLOUR MEASURE is; this says what a COLUMN ESTIMATES. The `scale`
# attribute is one key into EST_SCALES, the declared record library; fmt_scale_of() resolves the
# per-column parts (the ladder, SD(Y), the secondary axis). What a column estimates is STORED, never
# re-derived from a display, a family, or whether `var` is non-NA. The colour measure and the
# estimate may live on different ladders (a `color = "adjustment"` Model_OR column has odds_ratio
# gridlines and an adj_ratio colour ladder), which is why each is declared separately.
#
# EST_SCALES columns, in the grid's own order:
#   kind       "effect" (there is a null to draw, and a stored interval can be tested against it)
#              | "level" (a percentage / mean / count: no null). A level column's own one-proportion
#              interval has no reference null, so the significance gate must not read it.
#   geometry   the WORD the producers' arguments resolve into: "ratio" | "difference" | "log" | "level".
#   var_kind   what the column summarises: "pct" | "mean" | "count" | "coef". With `pct_type` this is
#              the old `type` attribute, split into its two honest halves.
#   ladder     which break scale a colour MEASURE reads on this column: "pct" | "std" | "log"
#              (MEASURES$<m>$scale is a 3-entry map keyed by it).
#   neutral    the null value, on the estimate's own scale.
#   trans      the axis transform -- "log10" makes x2 and 1/2 equidistant from 1 (why a ratio forest
#              plot is logarithmic).
#   mult       multiplicative fold (the fmt_color_slots center-1 rule).
#   is_pct     the estimate renders x100.
#   est_field  the fmt field the estimate lives in (fmt_center_field() reads this).
#   unit       the axis title, as a KEY (translated at render, never here).
#   default_display  what a cell of this scale shows when nothing asked. WARNING: `odds_ratio` /
#              `pct_ratio` / `points` default to "pct" and NOT to their own `est_field` -- today's
#              behaviour on an exported constructor, so changing it is user-visible, not a refactor.
#   est_display  the DISPLAY_TOKENS token `{est}` borrows on this scale, so "the estimate, whatever
#              this column estimates" renders exactly as the column's own estimate always did. Its
#              token's `field` IS est_field (checked at load).
#   est_digits   the ESTIMATE token's own precision, a FLOOR (absent = the cell's). The mirror of
#              base_digits, for the scales where the estimate is FINER than the level it sits on: a
#              per-item odds ratio wants two decimals while the mean score under it wants one, and
#              one `digits` per cell cannot say both. It is not DISPLAY_TOKENS$min_digits: that one
#              is a default a cell overrides by asking, this one is the scale's own statement.
#   base_display  the token `{base}` borrows: the LEVEL beside the estimate (a percentage, a mean, a
#              count). NA where the level is ambiguous -- on a link scale a coefficient may sit over a
#              probability or over a mean, and guessing would be a lie; `{base}` renders void there.
#   base_digits  the LEVEL's own precision, absent = the cell's. One `digits` per cell serves every
#              token of it, so an estimate needing a decimal (a risk difference in points) would drag
#              its percentage aside to "50.8 %". Declared only on the EFFECT scales, where `{base}`
#              really is an aside -- on a LEVEL scale `{base}` IS the estimate and the column's own
#              `digits` is the user's answer. A template may override it per token, "{base:2}", which
#              is how `tab_reg(digits = c(base = 2))` is written.
#   const_display the token a regression's BASELINE row renders: the quantity this column's effects
#              OPERATE ON. Odds ratios multiply odds, so an odds column shows the baseline odds; risk
#              and rate ratios multiply the level, and differences add to it, so those show the level
#              itself; a coefficient adds on the link scale. NA on the level scales, which have no
#              baseline row. A LEVEL token here also means the row carries no p-value: there is no
#              null a percentage or a mean could be tested against.
#   break_key  the ESTIMATE's ladder in color_scales(); NA = no ladder, use the device's own breaks.
#   gap_key    the adj_* ladder its GAP reads (fmt_gap_scale_key() reads this).
#   label_meas which MEASURES row supplies this scale's glyphs -- the forest axis's break labels AND
#              the multiplicative cell rendering ("odds_ratio" -> "1/2" / "2", "ratio" -> "/2" / "x2").
#              ONE declaration per measure, so a cell, its ladder and its axis cannot disagree.
#              WARNING: a MEASURES KEY -- a rename must reach here or both lose their glyphs.
#   sec        NULL, or the secondary axis this scale needs to stay readable: when the colour ladder
#              lives on a different scale from the printed estimate, that ladder's scale is the axis.
#   sd_from    where the SD-standardized ladder's divisor comes from: a regression column's stored
#              var(Y) ("var") or a crosstab cell's REFERENCE variance ("ref_var"). NULL = none.
#
# `level_twin` / `effect_twin` are DERIVED from `var_kind` and `kind` just below the grid, never
# declared: forest_plot(what =) reads them to name a column's other side.

# === THE DECLARED reconcile rules of the per-column attributes ================================
# ==============================================================================================
# The four reconstructor families (vec_ptype2 / vec_cast / vec_arith / vec_math, at the bottom of
# this file) are DRIVEN by this table, exactly as `meta_bind_rules` + tab_meta_bind()
# (R/tab_classes.R) drive the table-level `meta`.
#
#   ADDING AN ATTRIBUTE = add a formal to new_fmt() + ONE row here. Nothing else.
#
# The declared columns:
#   neutral  the value a MISMATCH collapses to (binding unlike columns is allowed but loses the
#            mismatched metadata). Also the value the "neutral" arith policy forces.
#   merge    how vec_ptype2 (= every c() / bind / group) reconciles two columns:
#              "same"        identical -> x's value, else `neutral`
#              "comp3"       like "same" but THREE-valued: comp_all is NA on count columns, and
#                            NA-vs-set must stay NA (a bare if() on `==` would ERROR)
#              "elementwise" `color` is length 1 OR 2 (text + background); each channel reconciles alone
#              "min"         the widest critical value wins -> the smallest positive finite `degf`
#              "weakest"     basis_weakest(): a merge claims only what its weakest part carried
#   arith    the per-context policy of vec_arith (fmt +-*/ fmt):
#              "merge"    reconcile, like ptype2
#              "neutral"  FORCED to the neutral (a sum of two columns is never a total column)
#              "x"        taken from x blindly -- a DISPLAY fact, not an inferential one
#   scalar   stored length 1 (new_fmt() `[1]`-subsets these); `color` is carried WHOLE.
#   write    THE writer -- the attribute's own setter, so validation is stated once and the generic
#            `fmt_attr<-()` cannot become a second, laxer way to write it. Adding an attribute without
#            a writer fails the build.
#
# vec_cast takes every attribute from `to`, vec_math (sum/mean) from `.x` -- neither needs a column here.
#
# WARNING: `arith` is NOT uniformly "merge". `totcol`/`refcol` are forced FALSE (arithmetic destroys
# the position that made a column a total/reference one); the display facts follow x (a mutate() keeps
# the colour); the inferential trio `conf_level`/`degf`/`basis` RECONCILE (weakest-claim), so
# `design_col + n_col` cannot claim "design".

# === THE GENERIC ATTRIBUTE ACCESSOR ==========================================
# `fmt_col_attrs` declares the 16 attributes exhaustively, by build-time assertion -- and the
# EXPORTED accessors were ~23 hand-written functions beside it, neither exhaustive (four attributes
# had none) nor consistent (the `ref` pair did not share a stem). That is the last hand-written
# mirror of the attribute table, and it grew with every phase that stored a fact.
#
# THE ADMISSION TEST, stated here beside the one that governs a new attribute: *storing a fact is
# internal; exporting its accessor is a user contract -- name the user story first.* Since 20a the
# answer to "a 17th attribute needs an accessor" is NO: fmt_attr() reaches it the day it exists.
#
# TWO SURFACES, deliberately, and the distinction is what keeps this from being duplication:
#   the NAMED accessors  are the TAUGHT surface -- a user writes get_scale(x), and the vignettes do.
#                        They live on `?fmt_attributes`, beside this page.
#   fmt_attr()           is the PROGRAMMATIC one -- a helper loops over fmt_col_attrs, and until now
#                        had to write a switch over 16 function names to do it.
#
# ⚠ THE HOT PATH STAYS HAND-WRITTEN (the DISPLAY_TOKENS / fmt_attr_rules precedent). get_col_var()
# (33 call sites in R/), is_totrow() (44) and get_scale() are untouched: they are `attr()` reads on
# O(columns) loops, and routing them through a table lookup would buy nothing and cost a dispatch.
#
# ⚠ RAW, not resolved. fmt_attr() returns the STORED value with the declared `neutral` default. Three
# named getters do more than read -- get_conf_level() falls back to the option, get_degf() maps NA to
# Inf, get_basis() folds "" to "n" -- and those are RESOLVERS, which is why they stay internal: the
# question "what does this column claim" and "what will the engine use" are two questions.

#' Read or write one `fmt` column attribute, by name
#'
#' @description
#' The generic form of the `get_*()` / `set_*()` family: one function covering every per-column
#' attribute a `tabxplor_fmt` vector carries, so a helper can loop over them instead of naming each.
#' The named accessors ([get_scale()], [get_col_var()], [is_totcol()], …) remain the readable way to
#' address one known attribute.
#'
#' @param x A `tabxplor_fmt` vector, or a data.frame (then every `fmt` column is read).
#' @param name The attribute: one of `"scale"`, `"comp_all"`, `"ref"`, `"pct_type"`, `"col_var"`,
#'   `"col_group"`, `"totcol"`, `"refcol"`, `"color"`, `"color_signif"`, `"model_family"`, `"role"`,
#'   `"conf_level"`, `"degf"`, `"basis"`, `"ci_method"`. An unknown name is an error naming the set.
#' @param value The new value. Written through the attribute's own setter, so it is validated
#'   exactly as `set_scale()` and friends validate it.
#'
#' @return The stored value (its declared default when the attribute is unset). On a data.frame, one
#'   entry per `fmt` column, named. Writing returns the modified vector.

# DESIGN: the central display method -- every display mode -> a rendered string (or, syntax="excel",
# a numFmt code). pct is stored 0-1 and x100'd here; CI display is "moe" (+/-) or "ci" ([lo;hi]) per
# option; the same masks feed excel_numfmt_code() so text and Excel cannot diverge.
# DESIGN: FORMAT() NEVER PASTES A STRING IT DID NOT RENDER. An annotation -- "ref:", "mean:", the
# reference "%" beside an odds ratio, the "(sigma sd)" tail -- is added only where fmt_rendered()
# holds for the annotation AND the cell; otherwise the cell keeps its own value. So a void field
# renders BLANK, never the literal "NA", and a blank cell takes no significance star.
# DESIGN: ... but A TEMPLATE'S TOP-LEVEL LITERAL *IS* RENDERED CONTENT. A spent primary blanks the
# cell only when the template has nothing else to say, so "{n_range}<sparkline>" still draws its
# curve on a row that has no count. Only bracket-group 0 counts: "(Chi2)" and "(n=" sit inside a
# group, which is what keeps a void p-value or a void percentage blank. No template the package
# itself writes has a bare top-level literal (asserted in test-display-grammar.R), so this reaches
# user-authored displays and the base-count sparkline alone.
#' Print method for class tabxplor_fmt
#'
#' @param x A fmt object.
#' @param ... Other parameters.
#' @param html Should html tags be added (to print confidence intervals as subscripts) ?
#' @param na How `NA`s should be printed. Default to `NA`.
#' @param special_formatting Set to `TRUE` to print more verbose results,
#' like indicating which is the reference row or col for differences.
#' @param stars Append significance stars after the value (opt-in; default `FALSE`). Stars appear
#' only where a per-cell p-value was stored (diff-type CIs / regression coefficients) and are
#' right-padded so numbers stay aligned. They **support** the number rather than compete with it: in
#' every theme they are drawn like an aside -- the chrome's secondary grey, never bold, italic or
#' underlined -- so a run of symbols never shouts louder than the value it qualifies. The main
#' display (console, [tab_kable()], [tab_md()]) sets this `TRUE`; tooltip / secondary-field
#' re-renders leave it `FALSE`, so stars never leak.
#' @param theme Which palette the cells are being rendered in. Only the black-and-white publication
#' palettes use it: `theme = "print_marks"` writes a repeated superscript mark after each value
#' instead of the significance stars, drawn exactly like them (see `stars`). `NULL` (the default)
#' renders no palette annotation at all.
#' @param bold_split Internal (default `FALSE`): when `TRUE`, attach a per-cell `primary_nchar`
#' attribute giving the bold-prefix width of a composite `"{pct} (n={n})"` cell, so exporters can
#' bold only the primary field in a bold row. Off by default -> the output is attribute-free.
#' @param pad The character used to align numbers: it pads values (composite displays, significance
#' stars, confidence intervals, a mean with no sd) **and separates thousands**. Defaults to a plain
#' space, or to a **figure space** (`U+2007`, exactly one digit wide) when `html = TRUE`. Media read in
#' a monospace font (the console, markdown) want the plain space; media rendered in a proportional font
#' (html, Excel) need the figure space, since an ASCII space is only half a digit wide there -- and CSS
#' collapses runs of them. One glyph for both jobs, so the thousands mark can never disagree with the
#' padding around it.
#' @param syntax `"text"` (default) returns the rendered display strings; `"excel"` returns the
#' per-cell Excel number-format codes used by [tab_xl()] (the raw value is written unchanged).
#' @param .ref Internal: precomputed reference masks `list(cells=, all_totals=)` (derive-once
#' speed-up passed by the exporter prep); computed internally when `NULL`.
#' @param .digits Internal: the precision one token was named at in a composite template
#' (`"{base:1}"`), passed by the composite expander; overrides every declared default.

#' @return The fmt printed in a character vector.

# set slightly back from the table's own text. That is the colour, and equally the FACE wherever a
# palette speaks through typography (a publication one): both are the measure talking, so both stop in
# the same place -- the face half is applied by html_cell_text() (R/tab-render-html.R), which is where
# the pieces are known. The split is possible at all because format(bold_split = TRUE) hands back the
# primary's character RANGE -- the same fact the exporters already use to bold only the primary field.
# DESIGN: THERE IS NOTHING TO CHOOSE HERE. Which shade an aside takes is a PALETTE fact, resolved

#     HEAD    the measure NAMED IN WORDS ("Percentage points (risk) difference:"), which is what a
#             reader needs first. Dropped where the subject already IS the measure (a regression's
#             effect word) or where the measure writes its own lead (the gap measures). Under
#             `guaranteed_effect` it carries the guarantee and names the interval ONCE, both channels.
#     LADDER  per side "<subject> >= <ref> <breaks> <unit>", the two sides joined by ";" -- ONE
#             sentence. Under `guaranteed_effect` they merge into one list after "from <ref>".
#     NOTE    what an UNCOLOURED (or, on a publication palette, UNMARKED) cell means. Only that:
#             "coloured => significant" is a tautology the cells already show.
# THE MEASURE IS NAMED IN TWO REGISTERS, both facts on the MEASURES row: `word` (short) for the
# console and a plot guide, `word_long` (per SCALE, via by_scale) for the export footers -- a
# difference of proportions, of means and of log odds are three quantities, not one word.

# fixed (non-translated) symbols, kept as \uXXXX so R source stays ASCII.
.lg_ge    <- "\u2265"   # >=
.lg_le    <- "\u2264"   # <=

.lg_div   <- "\u00f7"   # /  (division)

# The per-measure fact table -- every language-invariant fact of a colour measure in ONE place: its
# vocabulary (name / where it may go / who may ask / what it needs / when it is automatic), its legend
# words, and its engine facts. Adding a measure is ONE row; a per-measure divergence is a FIELD, not a
# switch arm. ONE row drives both the colour PLAN (fmt_color_plan) and the legend, so they cannot diverge.
# WARNING: every reader goes through an accessor (measure_facts / measure_policy / measure_key /
# measure_legal / measure_auto / measure_requires / measure_builds). A bare MEASURES[[m]]$field read
# outside them is the drift this table exists to prevent.
# Vocabulary fields:
#   channels     which colour channels this measure may ride: "text" and/or "bg". A whole-cell measure
#                (or / contrib) is text-only. THE single eligibility list (storage + argument boundaries
#                are two views of it).
#   producers    which producer can BUILD it: "tab" (crosstab core) and/or "reg" (tab_reg). Separates
#                "illegal" from "not available here": `adjustment` scores `obs`, which only a regression
#                fills, so tab() refuses it.
#   color_arg    whose `color =` argument may NAME it -- a DIFFERENT question from `producers`, and the
#                one the scope refusals ask. tab_reg() BUILDS `difference`/`ratio`/`odds_ratio` (its
#                columns are coloured on them) yet its `color` names none of them: there the estimand
#                is `measure`'s job, and what is left to choose is what to compare it TO. Read only
#                through measure_nameable().
#   applies_to   which column kinds it can colour: "pct" (a percentage) and/or "num" (mean/count/coef).
#   builds       WHICH per-cell fields the pipeline must compute: "diff" (diff + ratio, together), "or"
#                (the odds ratio + its Woolf interval) or "contrib" (the chi2 contributions). Two measures
#                sharing a `builds` class are a pure re-paint of each other (the jamovi "arming class").
#   requires     what asking for it FORCES on the build, a named vector of "always" or "gated" ("only when
#                a significance policy is in force"). Keys: ref / ci / chi2 / totrow / empirical / interaction.
#   ref_auto     the reference this measure picks when the user leaves `ref = "auto"`.
#   auto_for     the contexts in which it IS `color = TRUE`'s answer, per channel: list(text =, bg =).
#                Contexts named by what the COLUMN or model is -- "pct", "counts", "num", "reg_diff", "reg_ratio".
#   method       how the legend names this measure's TEST when it is not the column's stored interval:
#                NA = no interval (contrib), a closure = its own sentence (the gap measures). Absent =
#                the column's `ci_method` names it.
#   caveat       optional closure(spec) -> one sentence of honesty, or NULL.
# Legend fields:
#   word               the SHORT measure word, as a CLOSURE so gettext() runs at RENDER (a top-level
#                      gettext() would freeze the build locale; potools extracts the literal
#                      statically). A non-translated word is function() "OR". Used by the console.
#   word_long          the measure NAMED IN WORDS, for the export footers -- the discipline's term and
#                      the base measure together ("percentage points (risk) difference"). Mostly a
#                      `by_scale` fact, because what a difference IS depends on the ladder it is read
#                      on; row-level where it does not vary. `word_std` / `word_long_std` are the SD
#                      twins, so the standardized reading is a field rather than a branch. Absent =
#                      fall back leftwards (word_long_std -> word_long -> word_std -> word).
#   word_guar          closure(conf_pct) -> the `guaranteed_effect` head, as ONE msgid per measure
#                      (`word_guar_std` its SD twin). ⚠ NOT a shared "%s-guaranteed %s" template: in
#                      French the participle agrees with the measure (*differance garantie* vs
#                      *rapport garanti*), which no single format string can do. Absent = that
#                      generic template, which is right wherever no catalogue needs agreement.
#   subject            the legend's noun for what is GRADED, when that is not the cell itself. A
#                      column may be coloured on a quantity it does not print -- an odds ratio behind
#                      a percentage -- and "cell >= 1.2" would then be false.
#   break_over/under   the break-label glyph per side; break_scale = TRUE means a factor pct diff x100.
#   ref_kind           the baseline concept: "category" | "indep" (independence) | NA = the column's own ref.
#   threshold_mult     the grey-note first-break glyph is x (TRUE) or the symmetric +/- (FALSE).
#   unit_kind          the prose unit suffix: "diff" | "contrib" | "none".
#   has_ref_lead       the effect is stated vs a reference in the sentence LEAD (diff/ratio) rather than
#                      already relative to it (or/contrib/reg effect).
#   lead               optional closure(subject, ref, dir) -> the whole sentence lead, for a measure the
#                      default "<subject> >= <reference>" mis-states. Absent = that default.
# Engine fields (read by fmt_color_plan):
#   raw                a getter closure(x) -> the observed per-cell quantity scored + coloured.
#   scale              named c(pct=, std=, log=) of color_scales() keys, ONE PER LADDER; the COLUMN says
#                      which it reads (EST_SCALES$ladder), so a measure never asks what column it is on.
#   scale_from         (optional) "gap": scores a GAP, so its ladder comes from the ESTIMATE's own scale
#                      (fmt_gap_scale_key), not `scale`. Absent = read `scale`.
#   sig_source         "bounds" (an interval, via `bounds`) | "pvalue" (contrib -- reads the stored
#                      standardized-residual p-value).
#   bounds             (optional) closure(x) -> list(lo, hi), THE interval the significance policies read.
#                      Absent = the stored ci_inf/ci_sup; the gap measures derive theirs from `gap_se`.
#   gate_row           which structural row it never colours: "refrow" (a baseline) | "totrow" (contrib).
#   force_policy       (optional) the measure has no significance test of its own, so it ALWAYS reads
#                      under this policy (may be a predicate on the column).
#   by_scale           (optional) presentation facts belonging to a SCALE rather than the measure, for
#                      measures whose scale is chosen at runtime; folded in by measure_facts().

# The presentation of a gap measure's ADDITIVE scales, shared by both gap measures: a "+"/"-" ladder
# around 0, and the unit the legend names (points on a probability-scale ME, SD on a standardized one,
# nothing on a log coefficient). `break_scale = TRUE` renders the probability ladder x100.

# fmt_gap_lead() -- the legend lead of the two GAP measures. The generic "<subject> >= <reference>"
# states a SIGNED move (is the model estimate higher than the crude one?), which is not what
# fmt_adjustment_score() grades: it compares DISTANCES FROM THE NULL, so on a protective effect the

  # 1 on `adj_ratio`, a beta/AME/risk-difference around 0 on `adj_diff`. Both derive their interval from
  # the stored `gap_se`, so both read `color_signif` normally -- WHERE tab_reg could write one; where it
  # could not, `force_policy` (fmt_gap_force_policy) makes them read under `ignore`. The two SEs come
  # from different mathematics: `between_groups` compares DISJOINT groups (quadrature on the printed
  # intervals is exact); `adjustment` compares two estimates on the SAME rows, so its SE needs the
  # difference of their influence functions (R/reg-influence.R). Both are `producers = "reg"` (they

#' @param lang NULL (auto from locale) / "en" / "fr".
#' @param colored Whether to colour the break-words.
