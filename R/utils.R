# PURPOSE: package initialization plus the shared factor / list / string utilities.
# ROLE: .onLoad() SEEDS the package options and the colour palette; everything else here is a small
#   helper with no home of its own -- the base-R wrapping / padding / truncating primitives, the
#   NAME wrapper beside them, the retired-export-argument catcher, the two message helpers
#   (tx_inform_once() / tx_need_pkg()), and the three exported user helpers (score_from_lv1(),
#   gss_cat_data_formatting(), and the deprecated fct_recode_helper()).
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - TAB_OPTIONS (R/tab-options.R) is the single source of truth for option names and defaults;
#     .onLoad() only seeds them, through tx_seed_options().
#   - set_color_style() and set_color_breaks() are defined in tab_classes.R but called from here.
#   - A LEVEL LABEL IS PROSE, A VARIABLE NAME IS A COMPOUND WORD: tx_str_wrap() breaks the first on
#     whitespace, tx_wrap_name() breaks the second at the seams a name is actually built from
#     (`_`, `.`, `*`, camelCase). One of them was missing, so a snake_case name met no break
#     opportunity and no width could ever hold it.
#   - A VARIABLE LIST IS A LIST OF SYMBOLS: vars_chr(), never as.character(), which deparses a
#     non-syntactic name back into backticks.
#   - This file sorts second-to-last in C collation (only zzz-fact-keys.R follows), so nothing in
#     the package may depend on it at SOURCE time.

# WARNING: NOT base::strwrap(), and NOT a greedy fill. strwrap formats a PARAGRAPH -- it normalises
# whitespace runs, double-spaces after a full stop and re-flows across elements. And a greedy fill
# (take words until the line is full) gives a visibly worse table: it leaves one long line beside a
# nearly empty one.
#
# THE ALGORITHM IS MINIMUM RAGGEDNESS, by dynamic programming: over all ways of breaking the words
# into lines, take the one minimising the sum of (cap - line width)^2 over every line BUT THE LAST.
# Squaring is what makes two medium lines beat one full and one nearly empty. `exdent` shortens the
# cap of every line after the first, and is written back in as leading spaces.
# `whitespace_only` is kept for the signature's sake: a label breaks at spaces, never inside a word
# (a compound NAME with no spaces is tx_wrap_name()'s job, in the next section).
# ⚠ NA becomes the literal "NA": the wrapped value goes on to be a factor level or a cell label,
# and a missing one still has to print.

# === SECTION: wrapping a NAME, as opposed to prose =================================================

# tx_str_wrap() above breaks on whitespace, which is right for a level LABEL ("Never married") and
# useless for a variable NAME: `shenaniganing_colorous_property_of_the_skin` holds no whitespace, so
# no `wrap_rows`, no column cap and no rotation could ever hold it -- the defect the export review
# reported. A name is a COMPOUND WORD, and its parts are separated by declared characters.
#
# THE BREAK OPPORTUNITIES, stated once and read by every medium:
#   after   a space (consumed at the break), `_` and `.` -- the separator stays at the end of its
#           line, where it reads as "this continues below";
#   before  `*` (the interaction operator: `age` / `*tvhours` says which side the operator belongs
#           to) and a lowercase -> uppercase camelCase seam.
# `-` and `/` are deliberately NOT opportunities: they are far more often a range ("25-34") or a date
