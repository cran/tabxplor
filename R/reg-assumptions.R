# PURPOSE: THE MODEL CHECKS of a tab_reg() table, the `shape =` CURE for what they flag, and the
#   primitives their plots are drawn from.
# ⚠ `shape` ITSELF LIVES IN R/var-shape.R -- one vocabulary, one cutter, one label rule, shared with
#   tab(). What stays here is the half that is genuinely about a FIT: the quadratic TERM
#   (reg_shape_term), its per-model injection (reg_shape_add), and the Linearity check whose cure it
#   is -- one builder, so the check and its cure can only ever be the same object.
# ROLE: one fact table (REG_CHECKS), one selection rule (reg_checks_for), one producer
#   (reg_check_rows) and one label builder (reg_check_label). Adding a check is ONE row: the footer
#   label, its `stats =` value, its `check =` value and its panel title all derive from that row, so
#   they cannot drift.
#
# THE IDEA. tabxplor's headline feature is a comparison -- Model_OR beside Obs_OR, coloured by the
# gap and tested by `gap_se`. Every check here is that same comparison applied to something other
# than an effect: the SHAPE of a numeric predictor's effect (Linearity), the SPREAD of the outcome
# (Dispersion), the MEANING of an ordinal effect (Proportionality), the WEIGHT of one respondent
# (Influence). Collinearity is the declared exception and says so -- it is a property of the design
# matrix and biases nothing -- and it is here because it is what every textbook, and jamovi's own
# Assumption Checks pane, puts first, so its absence would read as an omission.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS A NEW STATISTICS ENGINE. Every one reuses code the package already owns:
#   Linearity       reg_fit(add_terms =) + reg_nested_test()  -- both fits in hand, no second one
#   Proportionality reg_ordinal_diagnostic()                  -- the Brant test, run where its row is
#   Dispersion      reg_check_influence_pass() + reg_if_se()  -- the sandwich, design-aware
#   Influence       reg_check_influence_pass()                -- the SAME sweep, read the other way
#   Collinearity    tx_vif()                                  -- Fox & Monette's GVIF, vendored below
#
# EACH COSTS WHAT IT SAYS, AND EACH DECLARES ITS OWN DEFAULT. Two of the five need a model fit --
# Linearity one per numeric predictor, Proportionality the Brant test's auxiliary logits -- and
# REG_CHECKS$cost declares that; the other three are arithmetic on the fit in hand, and the two
# influence-based ones share one sweep. ⚠ COST DOES NOT DECIDE THE DEFAULT SET: `footer_default`
# does, because what a table must say and what it costs are two questions. Proportionality is the
# case that proves it -- a refit, and a default on every ordinal outcome, because a cumulative odds
# ratio that fails it is not one number but a fiction. Linearity is the one left to `stats =`.
# What is opt-in is the p-value, not the diagnostic: reg_curves() bins the observed shape with no fit
# at all, and the sparkline and the reg_check_plots() panels draw it for free. Two of the three free
# checks also declare a `flag` -- the conventional value past which their footer cell is marked --
# which is a rule of thumb wearing the faintest shade, never a test.
#
# THE OBSERVED SHAPE HAS THREE PIECES, at the file tail: reg_curves() (one record PER OUTCOME, each
# binning its predictors with no fit), rd_spark() (the glyph run, drawn in a window with a FLOOR so
# noise cannot read as a shape) and reg_shape_table() (where the runs go when a cell cannot hold
# them -- the console always, several outcomes everywhere). Its two label columns each name one axis
# of the drawing: the predictor as it was DRAWN (marked by its `shape`) and the outcome on the scale
# the MODEL fits, spelled out by rd_link_text() -- the plain-text twin of the y axis rd_link_expr()
# builds for the plots, so a table and a linearity panel state the same quantity.
# ⚠ A CURVE IS NEVER FINER THAN ITS DATA. rd_bin() gives a variable with a handful of distinct values
# ONE BIN PER VALUE, and rd_spark() draws at most one glyph per bin: quantile breaks on a discrete
# column collapse unevenly and the interpolation then drew slopes between values nobody observed.
# ⚠ reg_shape_table() blanks a repeated outcome / group only within its own RUN, and sorts by group
# first so that a run is what the eye reads -- the rows arrive variable-major from the curves.
#
# THE CURE IS PART OF THE CHECK. `shape =` is how a user fixes a non-linearity without leaving the
# framework, and its design rule keeps it small: a shape either RECODES THE COLUMN or ADDS ONE TERM,
# nothing else. That split is also what the shape table's predictor column reports -- a recode is
# part of the drawn curve and is marked (`log(age)`), a term is not and leaves the name bare (see
# the section at the file tail). A quantile-cut predictor genuinely IS a factor, so it inherits the
# saturated crude twin, the per-level counts, colours and gap tests for free. It reads the package's
# shared per-predictor grammar (per_variable(), R/reg-resolve.R), so `shape = "quintiles"` cuts every
# continuous predictor and a named value overrides one. ⚠ ORDER: a shape recodes the column FIRST --
# it defines what the model's variable is -- and `ref`'s anchor then applies to the result, which is
# why the quadratic term below takes its square around 0 rather than measuring a centre of its own.
#
# WARNING -- i18n. `noun` and the `types` values (the instrument) are BARE MSGIDS and are never
# gettext()'d in the list: a top-level list evaluates ONCE at load, which would freeze the msgid at
# the build locale and make with_legend_lang()'s LANGUAGE switch a no-op. gettext() is applied by
# reg_check_label(), at render. Because those calls are DYNAMIC (gettext(ck$noun)), potools cannot

# THE ALGEBRA IS FOX & MONETTE (1992), "Generalized collinearity diagnostics", JASA 87:178-183: on
# the CORRELATION matrix R of the coefficient covariance with the intercept dropped, a term's
# generalised VIF is det(R_term) * det(R_rest) / det(R) -- the factor by which the joint confidence
# region of that term's coefficients is inflated by the other predictors. For a 1-df term it reduces
# to the familiar 1 / (1 - R2_j) of the auxiliary regression of that column on the others.
#
# TWO SHAPES, because both call sites read them: a bare named vector of VIFs when every term is
# 1-df, and a (GVIF, Df, GVIF^(1/(2*Df))) matrix otherwise -- the third column being the per-df
# scale on which terms of different width compare, and whose SQUARE is the familiar 5 / 10 ladder.
#
# WARNING: it REFUSES rather than approximates. Each of these returns NULL, and the caller then
# shows no row:
#   fewer than 2 terms         there is nothing to be collinear WITH.
#   aliased coefficients       vcov has dropped a column model.matrix still has: no alignment.
#   a rank-deficient fit       the same mismatch, from an unused factor level. tab_reg() drops those,
#                              but reg_check_plots() takes a BARE user fit.

#                              and a block vcov: there is no single R to take a determinant of.

# === SECTION: the quadratic TERM -- the one `shape` a fit adds rather than a recode ================
#
# The design rule is stated in the file header (THE CURE IS PART OF THE CHECK). Before this feature,
# `predictors = c("race", "poly(age, 2)")` errored, and the formula escape hatch silently disabled
# `empirical =`, `color = "adjustment"`, `multiplier` and the per-predictor tests.
# The recoding shapes (quantile groups, sd bands, log, sqrt) are in R/var-shape.R: they change the
# COLUMN, which is a fact about the data and belongs to both producers. Only a curvature is a fact
# about the MODEL, so only it is here.
#
# WARNING -- poly() / ns() / bs() are NEVER emitted, and that is a wrong-number refusal, not taste:
# `marginaleffects` returns AME = 0.000000 for them, silently, through every contrast form. I(x^2),
# raw polynomials and log() are correct through every route.

# The extra model TERM a numeric predictor's non-linear SHAPE emits, its scale frozen as a LITERAL
# in the formula string -- frozen for the same reason the multiplier's SD is: `scale()` inside a
# formula re-scales on new data. Returns NULL when the column cannot supply a finite scale.
#
# ONE builder, two consumers: the Linearity check refits with this term, and `shape = "quadratic"`
# emits the same one, so the check and its cure are the same object.
#
# ⚠ THE COLUMN IS ALREADY CENTRED WHEN THIS RUNS: `ref` anchors every continuous predictor at the
# argument boundary (R/reg-resolve.R, block Y), so the square is taken around the DECLARED anchor
# and needs no centre of its own. A second, self-measured centre would put the curve at the mean
# while the linear row sits at the anchor -- two answers to one question. Centring is not cosmetic:
# uncentred, the pair's own VIF is 38.7 against 1.2 centred.
#
# WHY THE LINEAR TERM STAYS RAW: eta = a*x + b*(x/s)^2 and eta = A*z + B*z^2 are the same model with
# A = a*s, B = b -- so with the default `multiplier = "sd"` the printed linear row ALREADY is the

# === SECTION: the plot primitives ===================================================================
#
# Five base-R functions, no dependency. They are the ONLY producers of the numbers every panel and

#
# WARNING for whoever adds a panel later: never `geom_smooth()`. Its `method = "auto"` switches
# loess -> gam at 1000 observations in the largest GROUP, so a facetted 50 000-row plot gets loess and
# an unfacetted 1200-row one gets gam -- and its message is assembled dynamically, so it cannot be
# regex-suppressed. Nothing here smooths: the comparator of a linearity panel is the shape the MODEL
# fits (rd_comparator), which is the whole point of the panel.

# The MATH a link scale is, as plotmath -- the second half of every linearity y axis, so the word and
# the formula come from one place. A character element renders verbatim in plotmath, which is why the
# outcome's name is interpolated as a string and never as a name (a name with a space would break).
#
# ⚠⚠ WARNING -- THE PLOTMATH GLYPHS THAT MUST NEVER BE USED HERE. R draws a math-mode SPACE (`~`),
# PARENTHESES from a function call or `group()`, and the operators `=` (`==`), `<`, `>` from the Adobe
# SYMBOL font. Only cairo resolves that font reliably: on `ragg` -- which is what Positron and RStudio
# draw with -- each of them comes out as a MISSING-GLYPH BOX, and the whole formula reads as a row of
# empty rectangles (measured: `~`, `~~`, `P(Y)`, `Y == k`, `Y > k`, `group()` all tofu; the same
# expression is perfect on `png(type = "cairo")`). So every one of them is written as a plain string
# instead -- `":  "` for the space, `"log("` / `")"` for the parentheses, `"p = P(x)"` for the
# relation. What IS safe is anything plotmath draws with a RULE, or as ordinary text at another size:
# `frac()`, `bar()` and a SUBSCRIPT (`"%"[level]`) render identically on both devices, which is why

# declared fact both read, RD_LINK_SCALES$level (`pct` = a percentage OF THE MODELLED LEVEL, `num` =
# a mean of the outcome). A reader who has seen `p = %Married ; log(p/(1-p))` in the table meets the
# identical quantity on reg_check_plots()'s y axis.
# THE SUBJECT IS NAMED ONCE, THEN THE FORMULA IS WRITTEN ON THE LETTER. `log(%Married / (1 -
# %Married))` spelled a long level twice and ran to thirty characters beside a table it is only a
# note under; naming `p` first says the same thing in half the width, and the letter is the one every
# textbook writes the link with.
# TWO SYNTAXES, ONE PRODUCER -- `html` sets the qualifier as a real subscript, which is the whole
# reason a percentage can afford to be qualified at all. The caller then does NOT escape this column.
# ⚠ ONE STRING LITERAL PER gettextf() CALL (the rule stated at reg_shape_table()): potools extracts
# what it SEES, so a formula assembled with paste0() inside the call could never be looked up.
# ⚠ Called at RENDER, never stored: gettext() must run under with_legend_lang()'s language, not the

# THE SPARKLINE: the binned curve DRAWN TO SCALE on the predictor's own axis, then flattened to 8
# block levels. There is no plain-text ladder: eight ASCII ranks (". , - ~ + = * #") do not read as a
# CURVE at all, and a reader who cannot see the shape is better served by no sparkline.
#
# ⚠ THE VERTICAL WINDOW HAS A FLOOR, and that is what makes a flat curve LOOK flat. A pure min-max
# rescale always spends all eight levels, so noise on a near-constant outcome came out as a dramatic
# shape -- the standing objection to sparklines (Few, "Best Practices for Scaling Sparklines"). The
# window is the curve's own range, but never narrower than:
#   * 8 x the median bin SE. The range of k independent bins is ~3.1 SE for k = 10 whatever the data
#     says, so a window of 8 SE leaves pure noise under half the height -- visibly a line. Measured,
#     not chosen: at 4 SE a noise curve still spent ~78 % of the run. Self-calibrating, no ladder.
#   * the first COLOUR RUNG on this reading's scale (rd_link_rung) -- so "uses the full height" means
#     "reaches a deviation this package would colour", the same threshold everywhere in the table.
# Centred on the curve's midrange, so a sub-floor curve sits in the middle glyphs and reads as a line.
# It still answers "is it a line?" first; the floor is what stops it answering it wrongly.
#
# WHY IT IS RESAMPLED. The bins are equal-COUNT (robust: every point rests on the same amount of
# data), so drawing one glyph per bin plots the curve against RANK, not against x -- and a monotone
# `shape` (log, sqrt) leaves rank order untouched, which is why the same curve came out for every
# transform. Interpolating onto a grid equally spaced in the SHAPED variable's own units is what
# every standard linearity diagnostic does (component+residual, empirical-logit plots), what the
# assumption panel already does, and what lets a reader SEE whether the transform straightened it.
# It also fixes the run's length, so every sparkline is the same width.

# WHERE A CURVE GOES is a medium question, decided once (tab_wants_shape_table) and answered in two
# ways -- inside the base-count cell of the row it belongs to, or in a small table of its own below
# the footer. The cell is the better reading (the curve sits beside its coefficient) and is kept
# wherever it works; the table is what the two cases that break it get:
# THE SHAPE TABLE IS THE ONLY ROUTE (22b-xviii, second round). The cell route was dropped for width:
# a curve plus the range it is read against is ~26 characters, and the count column paid them on every
# row of every medium that took it. It also never worked everywhere -- the console's block glyphs are
# East-Asian-width-ambiguous (a terminal that draws them wide shifts every column to their right, and
# a package cannot choose its reader's font), and several outcomes share ONE count column, so a cell
# of it could show only one of them. `options(tabxplor.shape_table =)` chooses where the table is drawn.
#
# THE PREDICTOR COLUMN NAMES THE CURVE THAT WAS ACTUALLY DRAWN, which splits `shape` in two. A
# `log`/`sqrt` RECODED the column in place (shape_apply), so the curve is a curve of log(age) and the
# column says so -- `log(age)`, `√(age)`, from the one SHAPE_MARKS row. A `quadratic` added a model
# TERM and recoded nothing, so the curve is unchanged and the column stays bare: marking it would
# promise a comparison this drawing cannot support (binning y against age² leaves a hill a hill, so
# "is it straighter?" would reject a parametrisation that in fact fits). A quadratic is judged by
# reg_check_plots(check = "linearity"), which draws the fitted parabola THROUGH these observed points.
# The curve itself stays FIT-FREE either way: rd_bin bins the observed outcome, with no model in it.
