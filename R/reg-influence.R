# PURPOSE: INFLUENCE FUNCTIONS, and the standard error of the GAP between two estimators fitted on
#   the SAME rows.
# ROLE: what makes `color = "adjustment"` a test rather than a description. A model effect and its
#   observed (crude) counterpart are both M-estimators on the same observations, so they are
#   strongly correlated: the naive sqrt(se_adj^2 + se_crude^2) is two to four times too large, and
#   Hausman's Var(crude) - Var(adj) goes NEGATIVE for logistic. The only quantity that carries the
#   covariance is the difference of their influence functions,
#
#     Var(theta_adj - theta_crude) = Var( sum_i ( IF_i^adj - IF_i^crude ) )
#
#   which is seemingly-unrelated estimation (Stata's `suest`; Weesie 1999; Mize, Doan & Long 2019).
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Pure matrix maths over `stats` + `survey`. No fmt types, no tabxplor classes: every function
#     takes vectors, matrices and a MODEL, and returns a number or a closure.
#   - THE MODEL IS A DIGEST, never a fitted object: every entry point normalises its first argument
#     through reg_digest() (R/reg-digest.R), and the working weights, the working residuals and the
#     per-observation scores are RECONSTRUCTED from (terms, coef, family) against the model frame.
#     So the whole gap test survives a distilled fit -- and a digest and its own fit give the same
#     answer, up to glm's one-step lag in the IRLS weights it stores (~1e-8 relative).
#   - EVERY FUNCTION RETURNS NULL RATHER THAN A WRONG NUMBER when its inputs do not support the
#     computation (singular information matrix, absent term, empty cell, unknown link). The caller
#     reads NULL as "no test here" and writes no `gap_se`; MEASURES' force_policy closure then makes
#     the column read under `ignore`, so a degraded path is descriptive, never falsely significant.
#   - THE MEMORY CONTRACT: never materialise the per-observation influence matrix. reg_if_from_parts()
#     exploits the fact that the score is a pure ROW SCALING of the model matrix, so peak memory
#     stays the ONE n x p matrix the caller already holds -- and the callers (R/reg-empirical.R,
#     R/reg-assumptions.R) keep to one length-n difference vector at a time.
#   - ONE SWEEP, TWO VARIANCES, never swapped: a g-computation maker returns both the delta-method
#     variance (the interval the marginal effect PRINTS) and the influence-function one (the colour's
#     test). reg_gcomp_maker()'s own note says why they differ.
#   - ONE CLOSURE CONTRACT, THREE SWEEPS. reg_gcomp_maker() (single-equation), reg_gcomp_cat_maker()
#     (one answer per outcome category) and reg_gcomp_rank_maker() (the ordinal superiority pair: the
#     whole predicted distribution in, one number out) return the same list, so the callers pick a
#     sweep and branch on nothing else -- and the rank one, answering once, IS a drop-in for the
#     single-equation path from reg_marginal_gcomp() downwards. Its own arithmetic is shared further
#     still: reg_rank_pair() is the one comparison the model column and its crude twin both run.
#   - ONE LINK TABLE, THREE READERS. A marginal contrast is h(M1) - h(M0), so a link contributes the
#     transform and its derivative and nothing else (REG_LINK_FUNS). Both g-computation makers and
#     the crude leg read it, which is why the engines never knew which measure they were computing
#     and a new link costs no arm here. ⚠ it is the REPORTED measure's link, never the fit's: a
#     logistic model shows an additive AME by default, a marginal risk ratio or a marginal odds ratio
#     on request, all three from one sweep.
#   - TWO CRUDE PATHS, by predictor kind. A FACTOR's crude effect is a saturated one-factor GLM, so
#     it has a closed form and needs no model; a CONTINUOUS predictor has no cells, so its crude leg
#     is reg_coef_if_maker() over the univariable fit R/reg-empirical.R built. Both legs are then the
#     same machinery over two fits solved on the same rows -- which is why the counterfactual takes
#     SHIFTS rather than levels for a numeric column.
#   - EVERY quantity the g-computation sweep produces is a WEIGHTED MEAN, which is why a subgroup
#     effect -- a crossed slope read within one level of its moderator -- is the same sweep under a
#     restricted weight vector (`mask`), and its influence function follows with no second engine.
#   - Design-based variance goes through svy_var_recvar() (R/survey-variance.R), the package's one
#     wrapper over survey::svyrecvar(); this file is its only regression-side caller.
#
# The orchestration -- which cells get a gap SE at all -- is reg_gap_se_columns() in
# R/reg-empirical.R; the printed marginal effects are reg_marginal_gcomp() in R/tab_reg.R.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the regression subsystem);
#      dev/regression.md section 2 (the derivation and the calibration study).
