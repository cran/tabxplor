# PURPOSE: tab_reg() -- one regression model per column, rendered as a native tabxplor_tab.
# ROLE: the package's second producer. It fits the models, turns each estimand into fmt cells and
#   returns the object tab() returns, so the colour engine, the accessors, the reshape operations
#   and every exporter treat a regression table and a crosstab identically. This file owns the
#   fitting, the column builders, the marginal-effects path, the footer and the staged build; the
#   estimand vocabulary is R/reg-estimand.R's, the argument boundary R/reg-resolve.R's, the crude
#   companion R/reg-empirical.R's, and the per-model product R/reg-spec-build.R's.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - ONE ENGINE PER SHAPE, each tidied from its own summary(): stats::lm / stats::glm unweighted,
#     survey::svyglm as soon as there are weights or a design, nnet::multinom for a nominal 3+ level
#     outcome, MASS::polr for an ordered one. survey / MASS / nnet / brant / marginaleffects / car
#     are Suggests, and every entry point guards them.
#   - CI AND p ARE DUALS, so an interval and its stars can never disagree. `ci_method = "wald"`
#     (default) builds the interval as estimate +/- crit * se and recomputes p from those same two
#     numbers; the crit refers to z where the family FIXES the dispersion (unweighted binomial,
#     poisson) and to t(df.residual) where it is ESTIMATED (lm, quasi*, weighted svyglm), which is
#     what makes it match summary()'s own z / t p exactly. `"profile"` pairs confint() with the
#     likelihood-ratio p, its dual.
#   - ONE REFERENCE DISTRIBUTION PER FIT. That z-or-t choice is made ONCE, in reg_fit(), and travels
#     out with the tidy (`disp_known` / `df_residual`); the marginal sweep, the baseline row and a
#     crude column refit from the same fitter all read it back rather than assuming z. Each column
#     then STAMPS the df it used (reg_wald_degf), which is what lets the between_groups gap SE be
#     recovered with the very critical value that built the interval. ⚠ the df is therefore NOT a
#     table fact and reg_finalize() stamps none: a model column and its crude twin are fitted on
#     different numbers of parameters. The DESIGN's own df is a table fact and lives in the model
#     record, where the "Model:" footer line reads it. The 3+ level engines refer to z throughout,
#     deliberately -- they define no residual df (reg_tidy_native_z).
#   - THE CASCADE IS RESOLVED BEFORE THIS FILE RUNS. `link` picked the fit (`sp$fit_family`),
#     `measure` what is reported and `effect` where it comes from, all in R/reg-estimand.R; here a
#     COEFFICIENT route reads the tidy and a PREDICTION route sweeps the model -- on whichever fit
#     `link` chose, which is why reg_marginal() takes the REPORTED comparison's link rather than
#     inferring one from the family.
#   - THE ESTIMAND'S DECLARED SCALE decides a column's whole shape: which fmt field the estimate
#     lands in (multiplicative -> `or`, neutral 1; additive -> `diff`, neutral 0, with `var` = var(Y)
#     where the scale asks for it) and which ladder it is graded on. No builder names a
#     family-specific field, and every column is built displaying the scale-relative `est` token.
#   - EVERY MODEL COLUMN CARRIES ITS ADJUSTED PREDICTION and EVERY GEOMETRY of its own comparison,
#     printed or not (reg_fill_base -> reg_fill_geometries): one pair of levels, read additively
#     (`diff`) and multiplicatively (`ratio`), the crude column deriving the same two from the
#     observed pair. That is what makes `display` a purely post-hoc property: choosing a layout
#     triggers no computation and changes no number, so set_display() on a built table gives exactly
#     what asking for that layout at build time would have given.
#   - `trials` fits a summed score as a GROUPED binomial (cbind(score, trials - score)). A model
#     FORMULA in `outcome` is the escape hatch: a plain `y ~ a + b` reduces to the outcome+predictors
#     path, while interactions / poly() / I() are fit verbatim and rendered from the fitted terms.
#   - ONE FORMULA ASSEMBLY for every fitter (reg_fit_formula), so reg_formulas() reports what really
#     reached glm() / svyglm() / multinom() / polr() rather than a second reconstruction of it.
#   - EVERY PREDICTOR IS FITTED AT ITS DECLARED REFERENCE. A factor is releveled, a continuous
#     predictor SHIFTED to its `ref` anchor (its weighted mean by default) -- both at the argument
#     boundary, so the fit's own coefficients are already anchored and nothing downstream needs a
#     contrast engine. A slope is invariant under the shift, so no estimate moves; what moves is the
#     Constant row and every term the predictor interacts with. Exactly TWO readers must add the
#     offset back, because they describe the variable's own VALUES rather than an estimate:
#     reg_spec_tips_num()'s tooltip and reg_panel_linearity()'s x axis (R/plots.R).
#   - THE CONSTANT ROW IS A BASELINE, NOT AN EFFECT: the fit's intercept under `conditional`, the
#     predicted outcome at the reference profile under `at_reference`, the population average under
#     `marginal` -- one quantity, then converted to the column's own geometry (reg_constant_cell).
#     Only the tested intercept carries a p-value, so only it takes a star.
#   - A 3+ LEVEL OUTCOME becomes several COLUMNS, not several tables: one multinomial fit gives one
#     odds-ratio column per non-reference category, one proportional-odds fit one cumulative-OR
#     column (its cut-point rows are dropped, so the Constant cell is empty). Both reuse the ordinary
#     column shape and share reg_tidy_native_z(), so the duality above holds there too.
#   - THE FIT LEAVES, THE DIGEST STAYS. reg_fit() returns a RECORD (reg_fit_record) whose `tidy` is
#     the only REPORTING-dependent member: the estimate and its SE are stored on the model's NATIVE
#     scale -- per ONE unit, unexponentiated -- and reg_tidy_finalize() writes the interval, the
#     exponentiation, the p and the `multiplier` scaling per (do_exp, conf_level, multiplier).
#     ⚠ EVERY reporting choice is applied THERE and nowhere earlier: that is the whole reason the
#     jamovi cache can key on the MODEL alone (jmvreg_fit_key) and serve each of them as a hit.
#     Everything else a column needs comes from the `tabxplor_fitdigest` (R/reg-digest.R).
#     Only `method = "profile"` cannot be served: its bounds are a likelihood output, so they ride
#     natively on the record and are scaled with the estimate they belong to.
#   - THE MODEL COMPARISON IS A DEFAULT. Several `predictors` sets are tested against each other
#     without being asked (`stats = NULL` resolves `compare = "auto"`), sequential where every model
#     nests in the next and against the first otherwise -- decided in reg_compare_rows(), the first
#     place the fits exist. ⚠ `compare != "none"` is what makes reg_specs_independent() refuse
#     parallelism AND makes the product KEEP its fit, so the boundary degrades "auto" to "none"
#     wherever a comparison has no meaning (reg_resolve_args): an ordinary table must not pay for a
#     row it will not print.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the regression subsystem).

#' All-in-one tables for regressions, with each modelled effect beside its observed one
#'
#' Fits one regression model per column and returns a `tabxplor` table of the per-family effect
#' measure --- a linear **mean difference** (gaussian), **odds ratios** (binomial), **incidence-rate
#' ratios** (poisson), one **odds-ratio column per outcome category** (nominal 3+ level), a
#' **cumulative odds ratio** (ordinal) --- one row per predictor level, grouped by predictor, with
#' the **observed (crude)** effect beside each adjusted one. Each cell stores its estimate, interval
#' and p-value, so the table prints with stars, greys what is not significant, and exports like any
#' `tabxplor` crosstab.
#'
#' To **learn** what such a table says, read
#' \href{https://bricenocenti.github.io/tabxplor/articles/tabxplor-reading-a-regression.html}{Reading a
#' regression} (`vignette("tabxplor-reading-a-regression")`); to **look something up**, the
#' \href{https://bricenocenti.github.io/tabxplor/articles/tabxplor-reg.html}{regression vignette}
#' (`vignette("tabxplor-reg")`).
#'
#' @details
#' New to regressions with tabxplor? A first model needs three arguments: `data`, `outcome` and
#' `predictors`. The model follows the outcome's type --- a two-level factor gives logistic **odds
#' ratios**, a numeric a linear **mean difference**, a count Poisson **rate ratios**, a 3+ level
#' factor multinomial or ordinal odds ratios --- so you rarely set `family` by hand.
#'
#' **The estimand is a cascade**: `family` -> `link` -> `measure` -> `effect`, where `"auto"` means
#' *follow from the left*. `family` says what kind of number the outcome is; `link` **which measure
#' the model estimates** (a link *is* a measure, so it takes the same words); `measure` **which one
#' is reported**; `effect` where that number comes from. Set any one and everything to its right
#' re-derives, so most tables set none of them --- and the one most people ever set is `measure`.
#'
#' A **coefficient** exists only where the reported measure IS the model's own. Ask for another and
#' it is worked out from the model's predictions instead, averaged over the sample. So
#' `measure = "ratio"` on a binary outcome gives a *marginal* risk ratio from the logistic fit, while
#' `link = "ratio"` fits the modified Poisson and gives its *conditional* one --- two different
#' quantities, and now two different arguments.
#'
#' @param data A data frame, **or a prebuilt survey design** ([survey::svydesign()]). A design's
#'   weights, clustering, stratification and calibration drive the estimation, and `wt` is ignored.
#' @param outcome <[`tidy-select`][tidyr::tidyr_tidy_select]> The outcome variable(s) --- bare
#'   names, quoted names, or any selection helper, exactly as in [tab()] --- **or a model formula**
#'   (the escape hatch; leave `predictors` unset). Several names give one effect column per outcome;
#'   with a `predictors` list, a single name is required. [reg_formulas()] shows what was fitted.
#' @param predictors <[`tidy-select`][tidyr::tidyr_tidy_select]> The predictors of one model --- or a
#'   **named list**, one model per element, its name labelling the column, each element selected on
#'   its own (`list(m1 = c(race, age), m2 = starts_with("inc"))`), which is how models are compared.
#'   Leave `NULL` when `outcome` is a formula. A bare name is a column of `data` first, then an
#'   object, so a variable holding names works without `all_of()`.
#'
#'   **`a*b` is an interaction**, R's own spelling, bare or quoted --- *"a's effect, allowed to vary
#'   with b"*. Two categorical variables give one row per **cell** of the pair; a continuous `a`
#'   gives its **slope within each level** of `b`. An interaction supplies both its variables, so do
#'   not list them beside it, which is what makes "with and without" an ordinary model comparison.
#'   `a:b`, which drops the main effects, is refused. See
#'   \href{https://bricenocenti.github.io/tabxplor/articles/tabxplor-reg.html}{the regression
#'   vignette}.
#' @param family The model family, **resolved per outcome** so several outcomes with different
#'   families can share one table. `"auto"` (default) detects each one and says so: a binary outcome
#'   gives `"binomial"`, an ordered 3+ level `"ordinal"`, a nominal 3+ level `"multinomial"`, any
#'   other numeric `"gaussian"` --- a genuine count is yours to name. Or set it: `"gaussian"`
#'   (linear), `"binomial"` (logistic), `"poisson"` / `"quasipoisson"` (counts),
#'   `"multinomial"`, `"ordinal"`. A **scalar** applies to every outcome; a **vector** aligned to
#'   `outcome`, or a **named** vector keyed by outcome (e.g. `c(income = "poisson", satisfied =
#'   "binomial")`), sets one family per outcome. Mixed families need a character `predictors`.
#'
#'   It answers **one** question --- what kind of number the outcome is --- and never picks a link
#'   behind your back: on a binary outcome `family = "poisson"` is refused, naming the two things it
#'   could have meant, `link = "ratio"` and `measure = "ratio"`.
#' @param link **Which measure the model estimates** --- the only argument that changes the model.
#'   A link *is* a measure (the one a model gives you directly), so it takes `measure`'s own words:
#'
#'   * `"auto"` (default) --- the family's own: logistic for a binary outcome, linear for a
#'     quantity, Poisson for a count.
#'   * `"odds_ratio"` --- the logit fit (binomial, multinomial, ordinal).
#'   * `"ratio"` --- the log link: the **modified Poisson** on a binary outcome (a conditional risk
#'     ratio), Poisson on a count, Poisson pseudo-likelihood on a continuous one.
#'   * `"difference"` --- the identity link; on a binary outcome the **risk difference**. It can
#'     fail to converge, and the linear probability model then takes over, with a message.
#'
#'   Reach for it when you want the model's *coefficient* to be that measure; to report a measure
#'   without changing the model, set `measure` instead. `"log"` is the one word the two arguments
#'   do not share: here the **log link**, on `measure` a spelling of `"raw_coefficient"`.
#' @param measure **Which measure of deviation is reported** --- a deviation being how far a group
#'   sits from the reference, the measure which of the ways of expressing it you read. The one
#'   argument most readers ever set, and the one that never changes the model. `"auto"` (default) is
#'   the model's own. The full word is canonical, the discipline's acronym a synonym:
#'
#'   * `"odds_ratio"` (`"OR"`) --- the odds of the outcome, times what.
#'   * `"ratio"` (`"RR"`, `"IRR"`, `"RoM"`) --- how many times as likely, as frequent, as large.
#'     Reach for it when the outcome is **common**, where an odds ratio is far from the risk ratio
#'     people hear in it, and because a risk ratio stays comparable across nested models.
#'   * `"difference"` (`"RD"`, `"diff"`) --- how much more, in the outcome's own units.
#'   * `"raw_coefficient"` (`"coef"`, `"log"`, ...) --- the model's own coefficient, un-transformed.
#'
#'   On an **ordered** outcome the first three read the whole predicted distribution rather than one
#'   category, so they stay in one column: Somers' `D` and the win ratio. Where the measure IS the
#'   model's own it is read off the coefficients, otherwise from its predictions --- so it is
#'   available whichever model you fit. `"auto"` never lands on a **predicted odds ratio**, a
#'   specialist quantity to be asked for by name. Call [reg_measures()] to see what an outcome
#'   offers.
#' @param effect **Where the reported number comes from**, once the model and the measure are fixed.
#'   `"auto"` (default) needs no thought: the model's own coefficients when the reported measure is
#'   the model's, its predictions otherwise. The other values name a reading:
#'
#'   * `"conditional"` --- read off the coefficients ("holding the other predictors constant").
#'     Only where `measure` is the model's own; otherwise the abort names the two cures.
#'   * `"marginal"` --- the **average marginal effect**: the model's prediction for every observed
#'     person, averaged. Comparable across models (Mood 2010), and always available.
#'   * `"at_reference"` --- the same at **one profile**, every other predictor at its reference.
#'
#'   The contrast is a **marker on the measure** in the header, so the acronym stays the one thing
#'   to look up: `Model_OR`, `Model_mRR`, `Model_refRD`. The observed companion carries the measure
#'   alone (`Obs_RR`), a univariable effect having no adjustment to be marginal over.
#' @param wt <[`tidy-select`][tidyr::tidyr_tidy_select]> Optional. One weight column, switching to
#'   design-based survey estimation ([survey::svyglm()]). For clustering, stratification, a
#'   finite-population correction or calibration, build the design with [survey::svydesign()] and
#'   pass it as `data`. See `vignette("tabxplor-weights")`.
#' @param trials Grouped-binomial (summed-score) outcomes only. The number of items behind the score,
#'   fitting `cbind(score, trials - score)` as a binomial. `NULL` (default) fits an ordinary binary
#'   logit; an integer (or a vector named by outcome) sets the item count; `TRUE` uses each
#'   outcome's observed maximum. Requires `family = "binomial"`.
#' @param conf_level Confidence level for the intervals. `NULL` (default) reads
#'   `options(tabxplor.conf_level)` --- 0.95. It drives every interval, the significance stars, the
#'   greying under `color_signif` and the model-versus-observed gap interval, and each column
#'   records the level it was built at.
#' @param ref The reference every effect is measured **from** --- one argument, one meaning per kind
#'   of predictor.
#'   For a **factor** it is the level the others are compared against (a level name, or `"first"`
#'   (default) / `"last"`); for a **continuous** predictor the value it is **anchored** at (a number,
#'   or `"mean"` (default), `"median"`, `"min"`, `"max"`).
#'
#'   Anchoring a continuous predictor **does not change its own effect** --- a slope is the same
#'   wherever you start reading it from --- but it does move the **Constant** row; its own row says
#'   where the anchor sits, `per SD/13.5 (at mean/42.4)`. The default is the mean because zero is
#'   usually outside the data: nobody is 0 years old.
#'
#'   `ref`, `multiplier` and `shape` share one grammar: a value **on its own** is the default for
#'   every predictor it can apply to, a **named** one overrides that variable ---
#'   `ref = c("median", "last", race = "Black")`.
#'
#'   For the level of the **outcome**, see `outcome_level`: `ref` names the level you compare
#'   AGAINST, `outcome_level` the one you MODEL.
#' @param outcome_level Which level of the **outcome** to single out, as a named vector keyed by
#'   outcome name --- `outcome_level = c(married = "Married")`. It is the twin of `ref`: **`ref`
#'   names the level you compare AGAINST, `outcome_level` the one you MODEL.**
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item **binomial**: the level whose probability is estimated; it becomes the column header.
#'       Defaults to the outcome's **first** level. A 0/1 numeric outcome may be named either way.
#'     \item **multinomial**: the baseline category the other categories' columns are compared to.
#'     \item **ordinal and numeric outcomes**: refused, with the reason.
#'   }
#' @param tab_vars <[`tidy-select`][tidyr::tidyr_tidy_select]> Optional. One grouping variable ---
#'   the same argument as [tab()]'s: one sub-table per group, the same model(s) fitted **within each
#'   level**. Two readings of "does this effect hold in every subgroup?" come with it:
#'   `color = "between_groups"` colours and tests each effect against the first group's, row by row,
#'   and `stats = c(..., "group_interaction")` adds the aggregated test, once per predictor. For an
#'   interaction between two PREDICTORS of one model, write it in `predictors` as `a*b` instead.
#' @param multiplier How a **continuous** predictor's effect is scaled --- the unit its row reports.
#'   One unit is rarely a readable amount (a one-year change in `age` barely moves the odds), so the
#'   default is **two standard deviations**: roughly the span a binary predictor's own contrast
#'   covers, which is what makes a continuous row and a factor row comparable at a glance
#'   (Gelman 2008). Values: `"2sd"` (default), `"sd"`, or a number of units (`10` = per decade).
#'   Same grammar as `ref`: `multiplier = c("sd", age = 10)`.
#'
#'   The estimate, its interval and the observed companion all scale together; the p-value does not
#'   move. **Because the default is not 1, a continuous predictor's `Model_*` cell does not equal
#'   `exp(coef(glm(...)))` unless you pass `multiplier = 1`.**
#' @param shape How a **continuous** predictor enters the model, when one straight line is not
#'   enough. The `Linearity` footer row and the little curve drawn in the predictor's `n` cell tell
#'   you *whether* a line is enough; this argument is how you fix it without leaving the framework.
#'   Same grammar as `multiplier` and `ref` --- `shape = "quintiles"` cuts every continuous
#'   predictor, `shape = c(age = "quadratic")` only that one, and anything unnamed stays linear:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"linear"`}{one slope (the default).}
#'     \item{`"quintiles"` / `"quartiles"` / an integer `k`}{cut into `k` quantile groups, so the
#'       predictor becomes an ordinary **factor**: one estimate per group, its own observed
#'       companion, counts and colours per group --- the non-linearity becomes visible in the printed
#'       numbers. Start here; it is the most readable answer.}
#'     \item{`"sd_bands"`}{cut at the **mean and one standard deviation either side** --- the
#'       classic low / average / high reading, whose cut points mean the same thing across
#'       sub-samples, where quantiles move with each one. The bands are not balanced: prefer
#'       quantiles when the group sizes matter.}
#'     \item{`"quadratic"`}{adds a curvature term, so the predictor takes **two rows** --- the slope
#'       at the mean, and whether it flattens or accelerates away from it.}
#'     \item{`"log"` / `"sqrt"`}{fit `log(x)` / `sqrt(x)` instead of `x` --- diminishing returns.}
#'   }
#'   Example: `shape = c(age = "quadratic", income = "log")`. The observed companion is fitted with
#'   the same shape, so the comparison stays like with like. It is the vocabulary [tab()] takes
#'   ([shape_numeric_var()]) plus `"quadratic"`, which is a model term.
#' @param empirical Show the **observed, unadjusted (crude)** effect beside each modelled one ---
#'   the same quantity fitted with a single predictor, on exactly the same people. The distance
#'   between the two is what adjustment changed, read left to right; it is the feature the package
#'   exists for. `TRUE` (**the default**) or `FALSE`; three spellings say *where* it goes, and in
#'   every one but `"no"` it is stored in the `obs` field and read by `$obs`,
#'   `color = "adjustment"`, [forest_plot()] and the hover tooltip:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `TRUE` --- a crude **column** beside the model one, except where that would double a
#'       table already wide (`tab_vars` groups, a 3+ level outcome), which take `"tooltip"`.
#'     \item `"column"` --- always the column, per outcome category if that is what it takes.
#'     \item `"tooltip"` --- computed, printed nowhere. The narrowest table.
#'     \item `"cell"` --- **inside** the model cell, `(1/1.69) 1/1.63***`. `display` overrides it.
#'   }
#'   The two columns are the same column twice: same estimand, same colour ladder, one legend block.
#'   Each cell prints the effect with the level it sits on --- the observed percentage or mean on the
#'   crude side, the **adjusted** prediction on the model side. A **continuous** predictor has no
#'   levels, so its crude cell is the univariable slope, which assumes linearity: check that with
#'   `shape` first.
#' @param n How many people the table is about. `NULL` (default) reads `options(tabxplor.n)` ---
#'   `"range"`, which adds an `n` column holding the **unadjusted count** behind each predictor
#'   level, on the model's own complete cases. Where several models rest on different people it
#'   prints the whole range (`5 139-9 862`), so an unequal base cannot pass unnoticed; `"min"` shows
#'   the smallest count only, `"no"` none. Continuous predictors are left blank: their count is the
#'   model N, the first footer row.
#' @param stats The statistics shown in the model-summary **footer** (one block per model).
#'   `"auto"` (default) uses the per-family set --- R square, adjusted R square, the overall F-test
#'   and the residual SD for a linear model, the likelihood-ratio test against the null model,
#'   McFadden's pseudo-R square, AIC and BIC otherwise --- plus the default **model checks** (see
#'   below). A weighted model shows the survey-appropriate set. Pass a character vector to pick
#'   them: `"n"`, `"lr_null"`, `"mcfadden_r2"`, `"aic"`, `"bic"`, `"phi"`, `"r2"`, `"r2_adj"`,
#'   `"f_model"`, `"sigma"`, `"global"`, `"interaction"`, `"group_interaction"`, `"linearity"`,
#'   `"proportionality"`, `"dispersion"`, `"influence"`, `"collinearity"`; `"all"` for everything,
#'   or `NULL` / `FALSE` / `"no"` to hide the footer.
#'
#'   **Model comparison happens by default** wherever it means anything --- when `predictors` is a
#'   list of several models. Where each nests in the next, every model is tested against the
#'   previous one; otherwise each against the first. `"compare_sequential"` and `"compare_baseline"`
#'   (optionally naming the model) override that, and naming any footer statistic drops it.
#'
#'   Three tests are asked for by name: `"global"`, one **overall test per predictor** --- "is this
#'   variable associated with the outcome at all?", which a block of stars against a reference
#'   category cannot answer; `"interaction"`, whether each **crossed pair** in `predictors` is real
#'   or the additive model is enough; and `"group_interaction"`, one aggregated
#'   **effect-modification** test per predictor across `tab_vars` groups.
#'
#' @section Model checks:
#'
#' Beside the fit statistics the footer carries five **model checks**, each naming an assumption and
#' the instrument that measured it: **Linearity** and **Proportionality** (p-values) say whether the
#' estimate means what it claims, **Dispersion** whether the intervals are wide enough,
#' **Influence** whether one respondent carries the result, **Collinearity** why the intervals are
#' wide. Four are shown by default; `stats = "linearity"` adds the fifth, and `shape` is the cure
#' for what it flags. [reg_check_plots()] draws them all. What each one asks, and how to read it:
#' \href{https://bricenocenti.github.io/tabxplor/articles/tabxplor-reg.html}{the regression
#' vignette}.
#'
#' @param display What each effect cell shows --- [tab()]'s display grammar, same names, same
#'   meaning, on every family and on the crude column as well as the model one. `NULL` (default)
#'   shows the plain estimate, or, with `empirical`, the estimate with the level it sits on beside
#'   it. The whole vocabulary --- the named layouts, the `{}` templates and the per-token precision
#'   `"{est:3} ({base:1})"` --- is in [tabxplor-display]; the ones this table uses most are
#'   `"est_ci"` (`1/2.22*** [1/2.47;1/1.99]`), `"est_base"` (`1/2.22 (32.8%)`), `"est_coef"` and
#'   `"base_est_mdiff"` / `"base_est_mratio"`, which read the same comparison the other way. The
#'   **Constant** row holds the quantity the column's effects operate on, so it is read in one
#'   step: a baseline *odds* on an odds-ratio column, the level itself on an additive one.
#'
#'   `display` is **post-hoc**: every quantity it can name is already stored, so choosing a layout
#'   never triggers a computation and never changes a number --- [set_display()] on a built table
#'   gives the same result. It never changes the estimand, which is `measure`'s job alone.
#' @param color,color_signif Colouring of the effect cells. `color = "measure"` (default, `TRUE`
#'   equivalently) grades each cell on **its own measure**, so the ladder follows what the column
#'   estimates; `color = FALSE` turns colouring off. `color_signif` is the significance policy ---
#'   `NULL` (default) is `"grey_non_signif"` here, where [tab()] defaults to `"ignore"`.
#'
#'   What is left to choose is what each effect is compared **to**. `color` is positional,
#'   `c(text, background)`, so `color = c("measure", "adjustment")` answers "how strong is this
#'   effect?" and "how much did the model change it?" in one glance:
#'
#'   * `"adjustment"` --- how far each **modelled** effect sits from its **observed** (crude)
#'     counterpart: what adjusting for the other predictors did to it. It turns `empirical = TRUE`
#'     on. Set its thresholds with [set_color_breaks()] (`adj_ratio`, `adj_diff`, `adj_diff_std`).
#'   * `"between_groups"` --- with `tab_vars`, how far each group's effect sits from the **first**
#'     group's: a per-predictor reading of effect modification.
#'
#'   The two are mutually exclusive, and each always tests its own gap: a gap whose interval covers
#'   zero is greyed whatever `color_signif` says --- so a cell can be filled while neither estimate
#'   carries a star, which is correct rather than odd. A conditional **odds ratio** is not
#'   collapsible, so there the colours stay descriptive and are not tested. Read a coloured cell as
#'   "adjustment moved this effect", not as "this variable is a confounder". See
#'   \href{https://bricenocenti.github.io/tabxplor/articles/tabxplor-reg.html}{the regression
#'   vignette}.
#' @param stars Logical (default `TRUE` for regression tables, where significance stars are
#'   standard). When `FALSE`, the per-cell p-value is dropped and no stars are shown (colours still
#'   read the interval).
#' @param na Which rows each model is fitted on --- the grain at which missing values are dropped.
#'   `"drop_by_outcome"` (default) gives every model **of one outcome** the same complete-case
#'   population, which is what makes the comparisons honest: the observed columns are computed on
#'   exactly the model's rows, and nested models get equal N. `"drop_by_model"` lets each model use
#'   its own complete cases --- more rows, at the price of comparability. `"drop_all"` shares one
#'   population across the whole call.
#'
#'   `"keep_for_predictors"` drops nothing but a missing **outcome**: every predictor keeps its
#'   missing values as an ordinary `NA` level, with its own row, count and effect --- often the
#'   fastest way to find out whether non-response is itself patterned. A number has no level to put
#'   them in, so a numeric predictor that has any is cut into bands.
#' @param digits The number of decimals. A single integer sets every cell (`0`, the default, means
#'   "each measure's own"), and a measure finer than the level it sits on keeps its own precision.
#'   Name a display field to set just that one, an aside included --- `digits = c(ratio = 3)`,
#'   `digits = c(1, or = 3)`; a template may carry its own, `display = "{est:3} ({base:1})"`.
#'   Left alone, a column reading in the outcome's own units (a mean, a mean difference) follows
#'   that outcome's magnitude, so a six-figure salary prints no decimals and a rate prints two;
#'   `digits =` always raises it back.
#' @param cleannames Logical. If `TRUE`, strips numeric prefixes from factor levels for display.
#'   Uses `getOption("tabxplor.cleannames")` when `NULL`.
#' @param subtext Optional character. A note shown below the table.
#' @param caption A title for the table, stored on it and carried into every export. Without one a
#'   regression table titles itself from the model it shows.
#' @return A `tabxplor_grouped_tab` (grouped by predictor), one effect column per model / outcome.
#'
#' @seealso [reg_formulas()] shows the formula each column was fitted with, and [reg_measures()]
#'   what an outcome can be modelled as.
#'   [forest_plot()] draws the finished table --- every effect with its interval, its stars
#'   and its colour, and (with `empirical = TRUE`) the observed effect beside it with the margin of
#'   error of the gap. [reg_check_plots()] draws the model checks. [tabxplor-display] says what a
#'   cell can show, [tab()] builds cross-tables.
