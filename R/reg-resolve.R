# PURPOSE: THE argument boundary of tab_reg() -- every check, and every rewrite of `data`, once and
#   in one ordered place.
# ROLE: the regression twin of tab_resolve_common_args() (R/tab-resolve.R). One entry point,
#   reg_resolve_args(), composed of six private stages; tab_reg() calls it once and receives
#   new_reg_args(), the typed record the builder reads (the FORMALS are the contract, the body is
#   as.list(environment()), and the globalVariables mirror is derived beneath it). One stage sits
#   OUTSIDE that call, S0, because tab_reg() itself needs its answer first.
#
#     S0 reg_select_*()           the tidy-select variable roles, run BY tab_reg() -- the
#                                 multi-outcome recursion above the boundary reads values. It also
#                                 PEELS the `a:b` interactions, which tidyselect cannot see
#     S1 reg_validate_args()      the checks that are PURE
#     S2 reg_prepare_data()       design unwrap / formula / predictors dispatch / the interactions'
#                                 parents / labelled / the level merge / shape / all_predictors /
#                                 tab_vars -- every rewrite of `data`
#     S3 reg_resolve_estimands()  the PER-OUTCOME TABLE: THE CASCADE (family -> link -> measure ->
#                                 effect) resolved into one estimand row, plus trials / outcome
#                                 level / crude key
#     S4 reg_resolve_output()     display / colour / the empirical mode -- and the notes, LAST
#     S5 reg_resolve_fit_plan()   na / the outcome's one-vs-rest collapse / the reference relevel /
#                                 multiplier / shape terms / the interactions MATERIALISED, last
#     S6 reg_resolve_specs()      the labels, the positive levels, the one new_reg_spec() call site
#
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN, between the stages and inside each of them. A fact resolved after a
#     block that reads it is a wrong number, not untidiness, so each stage states what its own order
#     buys.
#   - `data` IS INSIDE THE BOUNDARY, not lifted out of it. tab()'s arguments are answerable without
#     the data frame; tab_reg()'s are not -- `family = "auto"` is ANSWERED by the data, `trials =
#     TRUE` is, `multiplier = "2sd"` IS a number measured from it, `shape` recodes it, `ref` relevels
#     a factor and SHIFTS a continuous predictor to its anchor, and that relevel needs the
#     multinomial outcomes the family stage resolved.
#   - THE BOUNDARY DEFINES THE MODEL'S VARIABLES, THEN FIXES THEIR ORIGIN -- and every recode obeys
#     it, so the fitter never decides what it is fitting. `family = "binomial"` on a 3+ level
#     outcome collapses it to the chosen level against the rest (reg_binarise_outcome);
#     `na = "keep_for_predictors"` turns each predictor's missing values into a level, cutting a
#     numeric one because a number cannot hold one. ⚠ BOTH must also be replayed
#     (reg_prepare_replay), or reg_check_plots() refits a different model with the same row count. A preparation
#     the caller invoked separately would move the ordering into the caller: a second place to get
#     it wrong. The prepared `data` and `design_obj` are declared FIELDS of the returned record.
#   - S0 RUNS IN tab_reg(), AND SELECTS AGAINST svy_select_frame(), never svy_unwrap_data(): the
#     unwrap informs, adds the reserved columns and computes degf, so S2 must stay its ONE caller.
#     An empty selection becomes NULL, not character(0) -- every guard below tests is.null().
#   - ONE PER-OUTCOME GRAMMAR, four arguments. `family` / `link` / `measure` / `effect` share
#     reg_per_outcome() and are resolved together, in cascade order, by reg_estimand(): the boundary
#     slices them and never interprets them, so "what does auto mean" has ONE home.
#   - A DEFAULT MUST NEVER REFUSE, AND NEVER RESTRICT. Two arguments are now on by default, so the
#     boundary answers for them silently: `empirical` leaves as one of four MODES (reg_emp_mode) and
#     explains its degrade only where a word asked for it; and `stats`' automatic comparison, which
#     arrives as `compare = "auto"`, is degraded to "none" wherever a between-model test has no
#     meaning -- because `compare != "none"` is also what costs a build its parallelism and its
#     dropped fits (reg_specs_independent, R/reg-spec-build.R). An EXPLICIT key keeps its refusal.
#   - ONE PER-PREDICTOR GRAMMAR, three arguments. `multiplier` / `shape` / `ref` share
#     per_variable() (below): an unnamed value -- or one named `default` -- is the fallback, a
#     named one overrides that variable. Each argument keeps its own VOCABULARY; only the parsing is
#     shared, which is why this is a resolver and not a fourth fact table.
#   - There is deliberately no REG_ARG_VALUES table. TAB_ARG_VALUES exists because five crosstab
#     producers had each written one boundary and drifted; tab_reg() is one producer, its
#     vocabularies are already declared once each (REG_USER_FAMILIES / REG_LINKS_VALUES /
#     REG_MEASURES_VALUES / REG_EFFECTS_VALUES / VAR_SHAPES / reg_stat_keys() /
#     REG_MULTIPLIER_KEYWORDS), and an argument
#     that REWRITES what it validates belongs to its own resolver -- one validator, in the one place
#     that can also rewrite the value.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the regression subsystem).


# === S0: the variable roles ======================================================================
# The tidy-select boundary, run by tab_reg() itself (before the multi-outcome recursion, which reads
# VALUES). It shares tab()'s selector, tidy_select_chr() (R/tab.R), and adds the two escape hatches
# `outcome` and `predictors` carry -- a model formula, and a named list of models. Both are detected
# on the EXPRESSION where they are written inline, and on the peeked value where they arrive in a
# variable or spliced in by do.call(); tidyselect can see neither.
# tidy_select_chr(), or the quosure's VALUE when selection fails and the value is what this role
# also accepts. A CALL can build either escape hatch -- `as.formula(s)`, `specs[[i]]`, `f[[2]]` --
# and nothing in its expression tells it from a tidyselect helper like starts_with(), so it is
# recognised only once selection has failed. Any other failure re-raises tidyselect's own message.
