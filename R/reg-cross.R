# PURPOSE: interactions -- a crossed pair, prepared as a VARIABLE before anything reads it.
# ROLE: the SHARED surface, for both producers. The `a*b` entries of `tab_reg(predictors =)` are
#   parsed at the argument boundary, materialised at the end of the preparation, and read back by the
#   skeleton, the counts, the crude block and the footer test; `tab(col_vars =)` reuses the peel, the
#   validation, the autocut and the two arms, and R/tab-cross.R says what each arm means as COLUMNS.
#   Every message names its own argument (`arg =`).
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - a cross is prepared, never special-cased downstream: every subsystem must keep reading an
#     ordinary predictor (or, in tab(), an ordinary col_var);
#   - the two arms are declared in REG_CROSS_ARMS, never re-derived from a pair of kinds -- and the
#     kind a parent WILL have is what decides, `shape` included: reg_cross_resolve() runs after the
#     recode in tab_reg() and before it in tab(), and must answer the same either way;
#   - a parent may not also be a plain predictor;
#   - `a*b` must be read from an INJECTED literal as well as from an inline call or a variable:
#     the jamovi bridge builds its tab_reg() call with rlang::inject(), and quo_peek_extern() sees
#     only a bare symbol -- so reg_cross_slots_quo() reads the expression's own value;
#   - the block is NAMED AS IT WAS TYPED (`age*tvhours`), so the var column, the footer rows and
#     reg_formulas() all read the string the user wrote in `predictors`.
# See: CLAUDE.md section "tabxplor architecture" (the regression subsystem).
#
# THE IDEA, in one sentence: an interaction is a predictor whose levels are combinations, and whose
# univariable model is its own saturated fit. Prepare the pair as a variable and there is nothing to
# integrate -- reg_skeleton() builds `term = paste0(var, level)`, reg_column() joins on that term,
# reg_level_counts() counts a factor column, reg_crude_saturated() gives a factor the exact closed
# form, and reg_marginal_gcomp() sweeps whatever levels the column has. It is the same move
# `shape` makes for ONE variable, and `ref`'s anchor makes for one column's origin.
#
# TWO ARMS, and the difference is a parametrisation, never a statistic (`y ~ X*M`, `y ~ M/X` and
# `y ~ combined_factor` are the same fit -- identical logLik and rank, fitted values within 5.6e-16):
#
#   cells   both parents categorical -> ONE materialised factor whose levels are the observed cells,
#           every cell read against one common reference cell. Both parents are absorbed.
#   nested  the modified parent continuous -> the term `M:X` beside M's own main effect, i.e. R's
#           own `M/X`. The rows are X's slope WITHIN each level of M, straight out of the fit, and
#           the moderator keeps its own row block because the model contains it.
#
# WHY THE ORDER MATTERS. The pair is parsed in S2 (so both parents reach `shape`, `multiplier`, the
# anchor and the complete-case frame as ordinary variables) and materialised at the END of S5 -- after
# the shape recode (a parent may be cut to a factor), after the anchor shift, and after the relevel,
# because the REFERENCE CELL is composed from the parents' own `ref` and there is no second grammar
# for it.

# === SECTION: the surface -- peeling `a*b` out of a tidy-select ===================================
#
# THE SPELLING IS `a*b`, R's own, and it is the honest one: what tabxplor fits IS `a + b + a:b`
# (a combined factor spans exactly that, and the nested arm is `M/X`). R's `a:b` means something
# else -- the interaction term WITHOUT its main effects -- which happens to coincide for two factors
# and does not for a continuous parent (measured: logLik -14505.62 against -14443.20), and which is
# the origin-dependent model reg_cross_resolve() exists to refuse. So `:` is not a synonym here: it
# is intercepted and aborted, naming `*` for an interaction and `all_of()` for a column range.
#
# The peel runs BEFORE selection, on the expression and on a peeked value alike, because tidyselect
# sees an operator between two names as nothing but positions.

# framing is what covers both arms from one producer: a combined factor has no interaction TERM for
# drop1() to drop, but it still nests the additive model exactly (`y ~ a + b` is a sub-model of
# `y ~ a:b`'s saturated cells), and for the nested arm `M + X` nests in `M/X` the same way.
#
# It costs ONE extra fit, paid only when a cross was asked for: ~20 ms on a glm, which is why
# reg_footer_stats() puts it in the default set there, and ~0.5-1.1 s on polr / multinom, where it
# roughly doubles the fitting time and is opt-in through `stats = "interaction"`.
