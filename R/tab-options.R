# PURPOSE: THE global-option subsystem -- the declared table, the loader that seeds from it, the
#   readers, and the `?tabxplor-options` page GENERATED from it.
# ROLE: an option is declared ONCE, as one TAB_OPTIONS row: its default, its section, its prose, its
#   per-call argument twin, its synonyms, and whether .onLoad() seeds it. Adding an option is one row.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - `default` is the ONLY statement of a default. The doc page renders it, so the prose must not
#     restate it -- and `arg` renders the "Per-call" sentence, so the prose must not restate that
#     either.
#   - ⚠ THE FILE NAME IS LOAD-BEARING. It must sort before `tab.R` in C collation ('-' < '.'), which
#     is why it is `tab-options.R` and not `tabxplor-options.R`: tab.R's derived globalVariables()
#     tail calls new_ctx() and new_inference(), and new_inference()'s `conf_level` formal default
#     reaches conf_level_default() -> tx_option() AT SOURCE TIME. Everything else here is read at
#     runtime only, and every computed `default` is a CLOSURE for the same reason -- a palette or a
#     front-end probe must run at .onLoad(), never while the namespace is still being sourced.
#   - TAB_ARGS (R/tab-args.R) points at these keys through its `option` column; the edge is checked
#     at load in R/zzz-fact-keys.R.
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture (the declarative architecture).

# Read a tabxplor option that accepts synonym names; the FIRST set name wins, then `default`.
#   Pass the seeded/canonical name LAST -- it is always present, so an explicit alias must win first.

#' The tabxplor options, and their defaults
#'
#' `tabxplor` reads its display, colour, statistics and export defaults from `options()`, all
#' prefixed `tabxplor.`. Set any of them for a session with [options()], e.g.
#' `options(tabxplor.stars = TRUE)`, or once at the top of a script or `.Rmd`. The defaults are
#' established when the package loads (`.onLoad()`); most also have a per-call argument on the
#' relevant function, which always wins over the option.
