# PURPOSE: The jamovi backend for the `jmvtabreg` analysis (Regressions).
# ROLE: A thin orchestrator, the sibling of R/jmvtab.b.R. `.run()` reads the panel's options, restores
#       the fit cache from the hidden `cache_state` element's $state, calls the pure jmvtab_reg_build()
#       (R/jmvtabreg-cache.R, which drives tab_reg() with the cache injected), persists the updated
#       store, and renders through the shared jmv_backend_* helpers (R/jmvtab-export.R).
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - AN OPTION IS NAMED AFTER THE tab_reg() ARGUMENT IT DRIVES (or `<argument>_<slot>` where several
#     fold into one), so `.opts()` speaks tab_reg()'s own vocabulary end to end and no translator sits
#     between a control and its argument; test-jamovi-vocabulary.R checks the rule. ⚠ renaming an
#     option DISCARDS its value in already-saved .omv files -- accepted: this module carries no
#     back-compat promise.
#   - jmvtabreg.h.R is GENERATED from jamovi/jmvtabreg.a.yaml by jmvtools::prepare(); never hand-edit
#     it. `inherit = jmvtabregBase` is resolved LAZILY (at instantiation, in the running app), so this
#     file loads and checks fine before the .h.R exists -- and the .h.R LAGS, hence the `%||%` on
#     every read: in that window the module runs on defaults instead of aborting.
#   - A MODEL COMPARISON IS STAGED, not live. Refitting every model on each predictor edit is what
#     froze the panel, so with >=2 folded models the table computes only on Run (or on an Export,
#     which needs the result) and the fit cache is dropped outright -- see `.run()`.
#   - `stats =` has no control: tab_reg()'s own default already compares several predictor subsets, so
#     the panel asks nothing and sends NULL.
#   - The cache lives ONLY in $state -- it alone survives jamovi's engine reset. Never in an R global.
#   - The module runs in jamovi's bundled R: keep to what the package Imports / Suggests.
# See: CLAUDE.md § tabxplor architecture (jamovi) ; dev/jamovi_module.md.
