# PURPOSE: Characterization guardrail. Locks the CURRENT output of tab()/tab_num()/tab_many()
#          across an argument matrix, so ambitious internal refactors reproduce it exactly
#          unless a change is deliberately accepted (and the fixtures regenerated).
# ROLE: Core retro-compatibility net for tabxplor 2.0.0.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Structural fixtures live in tests/testthat/_golden/*.rds, produced by dev/make_golden.R.
#   - Display snapshots (tab_md) live in tests/testthat/_snaps/golden.md.
#   - A FAILURE here means output changed. If unintended -> a regression to fix. If intended ->
#     rerun dev/make_golden.R + testthat::snapshot_accept("golden"), reviewing the git diff.
# See: helper-golden.R (the shared case matrix) and CLAUDE.md golden regeneration protocol.
#
# ===========================================================================================
# TRIPWIRE LEDGER -- which 2.0.0 phase consciously regenerates which fixture, and why. On the
# current baseline every fixture below is GREEN; these are the DELIBERATE future changes to
# review at regen time (not bugs). [display] = also has a tab_md snapshot in _snaps/golden.md.
#
# Phase 1a (combined field pass, 15 -> 18 fields: +pvalue +tot_n +ci_inf +ci_sup, rr->ratio,
#   drop ci) changes the vctrs RECORD SHAPE, so ALL *.rds are regenerated once; the display
#   _snaps are held byte-identical via the set_ci/get_ci bounds-shim + NA-defaulted new fields.
#   Rows below name the SEMANTIC/display change layered on top of that structural 1a regen.
#
# Phase 5 (ratio-field repoint, §3): for pct/factor columns the `ratio` field now holds the
#   REFERENCE-RELATIVE ratio cell_pct/ref_pct (= the old `mean` x2 overload) instead of the
#   cross-direction tabs_rr it carried before. So EVERY pct fixture's `ratio` field changes
#   (was NA for non-OR tables, tabs_rr for OR tables) -> ALL pct *.rds regenerated once. `mean`
#   still carries the same value during the transition (Step 6 sets it NA for pct); the DISPLAY
#   is byte-identical (no cell displays the ratio field), so the _snaps are untouched. Coloring
#   is byte-identical (the x2 reads the same value from `ratio` now instead of `mean`).
#
# Phase 5 (color_signif attribute, §9.1): EVERY fixture gains a 9th per-column attribute
#   `color_signif` (default "ignore") -> ALL *.rds regenerated once + the fmt-contract snapshot.
#   Display + coloring byte-identical (the default policy reproduces today's behaviour).
#
# Phase 7b (argument-cascade consolidation): the color-cascade (color="auto"/contrib-forcing/
#   diff-family->ci/color split) moved verbatim into the pure resolver tab_resolve_settings()
#   (R/tab-resolve.R), shared by tab_build()+tab_counts(); numeric color="auto" -> the sibling
#   resolve_color_auto_num(), called by tab_num(). NO fixture regenerated -- the extraction only
#   relocates where arg values are decided. Note: `ref="auto"` stays at the leaf and differs by
#   type (factor "first"-under-OR vs numeric always-"tot"); this is byte-identical TODAY only
#   because tab_num has no OR mode -- a future "OR for numerics" (Phase 10) would flip the
#   numeric ref="auto" to "first" and regenerate the n_* fixtures.
#
#   f_row_pct/f_col_pct/f_all_pct/f_counts/f_ref_first/m_multi/totn_keep/w_weighted -> 1a only
#   f_color_diff    -> 1a only (FACTOR diff-color MUST stay byte-identical: the tripwire that
#                      Phase 5 does NOT disturb factor coloring)
#   f_ci_cell       -> DONE Phase 3a (ci half-width -> asymmetric Wilson ci_inf/ci_sup; cell CI
#                      also drawn on the total column, per decisions §1) [display]
#   f_ci_diff       -> DONE Phase 3a (AC -> Newcombe default interval + universal-inclusion stars) [display]
#   f_or            -> Phase 10/regression (rr->ratio done in 1a; empirical log-OR Wald pvalue +
#                      1/OR display deferred to the regression phase, NOT 3b)
#   f_chi2/f_subtab -> Phase 3b (table attribute chi2 -> test; chi2 pvalue field populated)
#   f_color_afterci -> DONE Phase 3a (after_ci reads the real CI bounds via get_ci upper arm) [struct]
#   f_color_contrib -> Phase 5 (contrib mode reworked in the diff/ratio color overhaul)
#   n_mean          -> Phase 2 (numeric diff flips ratio -> difference: field + display)
#   n_mean_color    -> Phase 2 then 5 (Phase 2 flips diff field; Phase 5 numeric color="diff"
#                      becomes sd-standardized Glass's delta with mean_diff_breaks)
#   n_mean_ci       -> DONE Phase 3a (mean CI z-half-width -> absolute bounds; z stays for cell,
#                      z -> Welch-t under stars for diff) [display: mean bracket byte-identical]
#   totn_drop       -> Phase 2 (THE motivating case: col_vars with differing non-NA totals;
#                      tot_n makes each cell's % base exact; [min;max] total-col range) [display]
#   f_totcol_each   -> Phase 6 (default becomes ONE total column; totcol="each" -> cosmetic)
#   f_selfcross     -> Phase 2c (tot_n field populated); display byte-identical -- locks the
#                      _colvarbis self-crosstab through the factor aggregate-core reorg
#   totn_row_drop   -> Phase 2c (tot_n populated; each col_var already divides by its OWN Total
#                      in the per-(row_var x col_var) forward pass, so DISPLAY stays identical)
#   n_mean_w        -> Phase 2a (weighted ML var rebuilt from moment-sums, within waldo tolerance)
#                      then 2c (numeric diff flips ratio -> difference); display (mean) identical
#   n_mean_sparse   -> Phase 2a (n<=1 / all-NA: the 0/0 moment-sum form must map to the same NA
#                      that stats::var/mean give) then 2c (numeric diff flip); display identical
#   fmt-contract snapshot (test-fmt-contract.R) -> Phase 1a (15 -> 18 field-vector rewrite; the
#                      8 COLUMN attrs are unaffected -- chi2->test is a TABLE attribute, not here)
#   f_chi2/f_color_contrib -> DONE Phase 10i-B Increment 1 (p-value rows are now DISPLAY-only: the
#                      built tab keeps the `test` attribute but no longer carries the "pvalue" body
#                      row, so these chi2 fixtures LOSE that row. Also, on UNWEIGHTED chi2 tables the
#                      `wn` field is now raw NA instead of the fallback `=n` that tab_pvalue_lines
#                      used to bake onto every row -- benign; get_wn() still recovers it, exports
#                      re-materialise it. tab_md byte-identical: the exporters materialise the rows.)
#   ALL fixtures -> DONE Phase 10i-B Increment 2 (add_n / add_pct are now DISPLAY-only too): every
#                      built fixture (a) LOSES its add_n `n` column / add_pct `col_pct` column / the
#                      pct="col" `n`/`row_pct` rows, and (b) GAINS the small `render_extras` table
#                      attribute (the add_n/add_pct intent, carried like subtext/test). The DISPLAY
#                      snapshots (tab_md) change too: the add_n base moves from a separate `n` column
#                      to an in-cell `{pct} (n={n})` composite on the Total column (decision 1). All
#                      of this is materialised byte-identically at EXPORT (proven: build+materialize
#                      == the pre-Increment-2 built table), so tab_xl / export-parity are unchanged.
#
# Phase 18s (Kish n_eff -> all descriptive CIs): adds a 19th per-cell field `n_eff` (the
#   effective sample size used for a cell's CI). This changes the vctrs RECORD SHAPE, so ALL
#   *.rds are regenerated once + the fmt-contract snapshot; the ONLY per-cell delta is the added
#   all-NA `n_eff` column (kish is OFF by default, so the field is NA and tab_ci coalesces to the
#   raw base -> CI bounds byte-identical). The DISPLAY _snaps are UNTOUCHED (n_eff is non-displayed).
# Phase 18z5 (the `adjustment` colour measure): adds a 20th per-cell field `obs` -- the value a
#   tab_reg cell's estimate is COMPARED TO (its observed/crude counterpart, or a reference group's).
#   Same shape of change as n_eff above: the RECORD moves, so all *.rds are regenerated once + the
#   fmt-contract snapshot, and a script proved the only delta is the added all-NA column (a
#   cross-table never fills `obs`). The DISPLAY _snaps are UNTOUCHED -- `obs` renders only through
#   an explicit `display = "{obs}"` and a tooltip fragment gated on a non-NA value.
# Phase 18z8 (the gap's significance test): adds a 21st per-cell field `gap_se` -- the standard
#   error of the estimate-vs-`obs` gap. Same shape again: all *.rds regenerated once + the
#   fmt-contract snapshot, with dev/verify_golden_field_delta.R (now committed, instead of rewritten
#   each phase) proving over 1787 cells that the added all-NA column is the only delta. The DISPLAY
#   _snaps are UNTOUCHED: `gap_se` is non-displayed (no token), and it can only be non-NA on a
#   tab_reg split table, which no golden case builds.
# Phase 18z13 (D3): adds a 12th per-column ATTRIBUTE `conf_level` -- the level a column's interval
#   and its significance thresholds were computed at, so the per-column colour engine stops falling
#   back to the global option. Not a field, so the record SHAPE is unchanged; but the attribute rides
#   every column, so all *.rds are regenerated once + the fmt-contract snapshot.
#   dev/verify_golden_field_delta.R (extended here to prove an ATTRIBUTE delta as well) checked over
#   1787 cells that every field and every pre-existing attribute is bit-identical and that the new one
#   is 0.95 everywhere -- which is exactly options("tabxplor.conf_level"), and why the DISPLAY _snaps
#   are UNTOUCHED: resolving the stamp gives the same number the option gave.
