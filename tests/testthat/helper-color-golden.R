# PURPOSE: Shared matrix for the COLOR characterization golden (Phase 5 safety net).
# ROLE: Used by BOTH dev/make_color_golden.R (writes tests/testthat/_color_golden/*.rds) and
#        test-color-golden.R (checks live color output against them), so generator and test
#        can never drift. This is the byte-identity net for the color/breaks refactor: it
#        captures the RENDERED per-cell colors (fmt_get_color_code hex), which every current
#        exporter and the console derive from the same selection path.
# KEY CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Every case DETERMINISTIC (fixed data / fixed synthetic fields; no unseeded random).
#   - fmt_get_color_code() is the per-cell color signal (returns one hex/crayon code per cell,
#     NA where uncolored); pillar_shaft() and all exporters route through the SAME
#     fmt_color_selection -> select_in_color_style -> palette path, so this one capture locks
#     them all. It reads the current getOption("tabxplor.color_breaks"); the new breaks list
#     (Step 1) is defined so the DEFAULTS are equivalent, hence locked modes reproduce.
#   - The synthetic factor-"diff" case exercises cells sitting EXACTLY on breaks (0.05/0.1/0.2/
#     0.3 and the x2 ratio) -- the tie behaviour that risk R1 (fold + findInterval, left.open)
#     must reproduce byte-for-byte. Factor "diff" is the LOCKED tripwire: it must not move.
# See: CLAUDE.md > tabxplor architecture (the colour system) ; dev/colors.md.

# The render combinations that cover all four palettes (Phase 13a): text / background x light / dark.
# type/theme are passed explicitly to fmt_get_color_code so the capture does not depend on the
