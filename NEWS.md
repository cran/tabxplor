# tabxplor 1.0.2

## Added : 
* With `tab_kable`, option to use html `popover` instead of `tooltips`, to be able to use it in rmarkdown with a floating table of content.
* Two new 24 bits color styles for hmtl tables (`"blue_red"` and `"green_red"`).
* Possibility to provide a custom color palette for color styles, using `with set_color_style()`. 
* `tab_core` was deprecated and renamed `tab_plain` for more clarity. Added options to render a table with normal numeric vectors instead of fmt, and to render a plain data.frame instead of a tibble. 
* Two way to print confidence intervals, using global option `"tabxplor.ci_print"` : `"moe"`, for margin of errors, prints as `12%±1.1` ; `"ci"` prints the interval `11·13%`.
* In `tab_kable`, confidence intervals of type `"cell` with print type `"moe"` appear in subscript. 
* In `tab_xl`, colors now are the same and works in the same way that `tab` and `tab_kable`.

## Bug corrections :
* With `tab` argument `color = "after_ci"`, when `diff` is negative, cells between 0 and -5% don't get colors.
* Problems in `tab_plain` with zero-rows dataframes 
* With `color = "contrib"`, no color when contribution is equal to the mean contribution (or a multiple of it).
* With `tab_kable`, white spaces are producing unwanted text wrapping (in the middle of numbers)
* In tabs and tooltips, `diff` not printing good with `type = "mean"`. 


# tabxplor 1.0.1
* Add possibility to export tables in html using `kableExtra`.
* Ensure functions do not write by default in the user's home filespace. 

## Bug corrections :
* Change color style not working in R CMD check : add possibility to change color style with global options. 
* Total rows appear even when not wanted in `tab` and `tab_many`.
* `tab_many` not working with `listed = "TRUE"` 


# tabxplor 1.0.0
* This is the first stable and published version of `tabxplor` !
